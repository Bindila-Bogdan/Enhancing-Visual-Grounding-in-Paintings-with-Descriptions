       " \"This small panel aligns stylistically with several other small panels produced between 1545 and 1550. These represent a miniaturistic style, independent of the father's manner that Lucas Cranach the Younger appears to have developed in the late 1540s.\",\n",
       " 'This picture, painted in 1685-90 by Paolo Pagani in the naturalistic style of Caravaggio, shows the lasting influence of Caravaggio. Pagani worked mainly in Venice, Milan, and Central Europe as a history painter.',\n",

       " \"The unusual pose that Lippi selected for his Mary Annunciate, with a strong twist of the body, has a parallel in Donatello's high relief Annunciation which the sculptor carved for the Cavalcanti Chapel in Santa Croce.\",\n",
       " 'On the left of the fresco Uccello depicts the storms that provoked the Flood as well as the damage and death caused by the rising water. It is one of the first realistic renderings of a storm in Western art.',\n",
       " \"The bookstand holds a tome open to a page showing the Last Judgment, which alludes to Jerome's meditations on the end of earthly existence. The exaggerated shapes of his hands are characteristic of Reymerswaele's figures.\",\n",
       " 'This painting juxtaposes Israelites who are raising their arms to heaven, in a desperate plea for aid in the face of the approaching Egyptians, with others who are already energetically rescuing the weapons of the drowned Egyptians from the waves.',\n",
       " \"This painting is in reality a genre portrait of Manet's model Victorine and the daughter of his friend Alphonse Hirsch, in whose Paris garden near the Gare Saint-Lazare the picture was painted.\",\n",
       " 'This painting is usually attributed to Louis Le Nain who takes the first place with his gatherings of peasants full of simple dignity and restrained energy and his new interest in country people.',\n",
       " 'The sitter of this portrait is probably the painter\\'s housekeeper, Madame Brémont, who was recalled as having \"loyally and respectfully taken care of her master.\" The portrait is marked by a lyricism untypical of Cézanne\\'s late works.',\n",
       " 'Eworth was a portraitist originated from Antwerpen. He worked from 1549 in England. His predecessor in the royal court was Hans Holbein the Younger who strongly influenced his style. This is well illustrated by the portrait of Lady Dacre.',\n",
       " \"The sitter of the allegorical portrait was identified as Francesca Gommi, the artist's third wife. While the painter and Gommi did not marry until 1700, the two had lived together for many years prior to their legal union.\",\n",
       " \"In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII commissioned this fresco decoration in the Vatican Palace. The allegorical fresco represents the triumph of Christianity (in the form of Christ's Cross) over paganism (in the form of a destroyed statue).\",\n",
       " 'In the background, the painting contrasts the dying pagan world with the new City of God, here celebrated in the guise of Venice. The represented saints in the foreground are Catherine, Peter, John the Baptist, and Jerome.',\n",
       " \"This painting foreshadows Csontváry's later visionary works. Against a background of blue sea looms an ominous figure with rough hewn features - a survivor of some sort, perhaps a fisherman of the Adriatic.\",\n",
       " \"In the Gothic vaults of the Tornabuoni Chapel the four Evangelists are floating on clouds.\\r\\nSt John the Evangelist is writing down God's words, which are being conveyed to him by his symbolic animal, the eagle, on a piece of paper.\",\n",

       " \"The portrait represents the painter's three children, his son Valér (1885-1954), painter and graphic artist, and the twins Béni (1890-1967), painter and graphic artist and Noémi (1890-1957), a painter who established tapestry in Hungary.\",\n",
       " \"In Millet's hands, the coarse materiality of painting serves to express the symbolic. In this work, the physical sensation of weight implied by the huge brushwood bundles expresses the abstract idea of humility.\",\n",
       " 'This portrait is the pendant of the portrait of Sir Thomas Gresham. Anne Fernely (d. 1596) was the wife of Sir Thomas Gresham since 1544. On the paintings, both Gresham and his wife are expensively, yet soberly dressed.',\n",
       " 'The musical angels depicted in the upper two pictures emphasize the solemnity of the glorification. Their ornamental clothes, painted with painstaking detail, and their natural appearance increase the power of this tremendous vision.',\n",

       " \"This early portrait by van Dyck was painted during the period when the painter was working in Rubens's studio. The elegant armchair, in gold-embossed leather, is probably the same as that in Rubens's Portrait of Jan Vermoelen from 1616.\",\n",
