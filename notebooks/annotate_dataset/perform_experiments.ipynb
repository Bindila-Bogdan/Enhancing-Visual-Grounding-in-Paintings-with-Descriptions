      "goddesses have sometimes been thought to be portraits of women at the Saxon court, their faces appear too generalized for such an assertion. The\n",

      "the context of its own time. The theme was popular with German humanists, and Matsche (1996) has argued for an understanding of Paris's dilemma\n",
      "in the context of the difficult choice of which type of life to lead: the vita contemplativa, represented by Minerva, the vita activa, represented\n",
      "by Juno, or the vita voluptaria, represented by Venus. The contemplative life was the most highly regarded, and also the most arduous; Paris's misguided\n",
      "choice may have served as a warning to the viewer against Venus's power and sensual pleasures. A challenge to the humanist interpretation was offered\n",
      "by Hinz (1994), who argued that for such an interpretation to be valid, the goddesses would have to be clearly identifiable in order to\n",
      "link them with the alternative ways of life. Instead, he regarded the similarity of the goddeses as an attempt to \"provoke a play of\n",
      "ideas and meanings\"—and perhaps to introduce an element of ambiguity—which has little to do with the rigorous humanism found in images by contemporary artists\n",
      "such as Dürer and Burgkmair.The theme may also be understood in a social-historical rather than philosophical context. El-Himoud-Sperlich (1977) has interpreted Cranach's Paris paintings\n",
      "as decorations for bedchambers, where they may have served not as warning to men, but as confirmations for women that their husbands had renounced\n",
      "what advantages might be gained by marrying a smarter or wealthier mate, instead choosing for love and beauty.Interesting but controversial is a third interpretation\n",
      "offered by Nickel (1981) of the work as alchemical in meaning, in which the goddesses represent the three stages of the so-called Great Work—that\n",
      "is, the conversion of base metals into gold. His meticulous argument has yet to be supported or refuted by other scholars on the basis\n",
      "of subsequent discussions of alchemy.Clearly, there is a rich array of possible meaning for the theme. Its popularity, evidenced by the significant number of\n",

      "As Brown and Kagan (1982) noted, The Met's painting belongs to a tradition of emblematic city views and derives its potency precisely from the\n",
      "representational license it takes. As with El Greco's finest portraits, its approach is interpretive rather than documentary: it seeks to portray the essence of\n",
      "the city rather than to record its actual appearance.Both here and in the View and Plan the city is shown from the north, except\n",

      "imaginary landscape showing the Camaldolese community seen against a mountainous backdrop: one in the Instituto de Valencia de Don Juan, Madrid, and a larger\n",
      "version in the Colegio del Patriarca, Valencia. Moreover, El Greco must have had a painting of Toledo in his workshop that could be used\n",
