        "description": "The architecture of the Aula Leonardi is dominated by a majestic fresco by one of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s most mature and original followers, Bernardino Luini. The subject of this mural painting is clearly explained by the cartouche at the top of the central bay, which bears the title of the work itself: Caput regis gloriae spinis coronatur (\u201cThe Head of the King of Glory Crowned with Thorns\u201d). The scene is divided into three distinct parts. At the centre, Christ is wearing a scarlet mantle and holding a cane as though it were a sceptre, and he appears to be seated on a sort of throne. His wrists are tied by a rope and on his head he wears a crown of thorns. He is surrounded by several soldiers who insult and mock him with strange grimaces, while two of them, who are closest to him, look as though they intend to beat on the crown of thorns with sticks, to press it deeper into his flesh. The two sides, on the other hand, show the twelve members of the Confraternita di Santa Corona, who commissioned the fresco from Bernardino Luini. There are six on each side, kneeling and wrapped in heavy black cloaks. Before it was taken over by the Ambrosiana, this hall was the chapter house of the confraternity, which was named after the Holy Crown of Christ and devoted to charitable work."

The image shows the Virgin Mary, surrounded by a fleet of angels, floating upon the clouds. Although many of his paintings depicted a strong version of reality, this painting soars in imagination, the Virgin clothed in light, a halo shining from the top of her head. The many angels, who drift around her in a playful manner, look upon her as if she is a precious relic to be revered and protected. Some of the others reach out to touch her in a playful manner, as if she is already their mother. "

        "description": "In [i]The Siren [/i] (c.1900), John William Waterhouse depicts an exhausted shipwreck survivor clinging to a rock. He sees above him a beautiful young girl sitting on a rock playing harp. The female figure is the siren, a magical creature that inhabits the ocean and lures sailors to their doom with her beautiful song. In the painting, she holds an abalone shell harp and wears a pearl decoration in her hair. She is in the process of transforming into a mermaid, the lower parts of her legs are turning into fish scales and fins. Her auburn hair color is also significant, as it became an attribute of the femme fatale in the 19th century. The siren\u2019s facial expression is passive and enigmatic, so it is unclear whether she intends to help or harm the sailor.\n\nWaterhouse created a series of oil sketches and pencil drawings of sirens and mermaids. They were used for several paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/a-mermaid-1900][i]A Mermaid[/i][/url] (1900), which was probably inspired by Alfred Tennyson\u2019s poem [i]The Mermaid[/i] (1830 ). In [i]A Mermaid[/i], the artist portrays a mermaid alone on a rocky beach: she is combing her long hair and singing the song of the sirens. [i]The Siren[/i] was also inspired by the same series of sketches, and the initial idea for the composition came from [i]Poetic Works[/i] of Percy Bysshe Shelley. However, unlike the painting, the sketch depicts a trio of mermaids. A possible inspiration for [i]The Siren[/i] was [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-burne-jones/the-depths-of-the-sea][i]The Depths of the Sea[/i][/url] (1887) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-burne-jones]Edward Burne-Jones[/url] that shows a mermaid dragging a sailor to the bottom of her watery grotto. In both paintings, the sirens seem like serene creatures that are unaware of the deadly effect of their song.\n\nWaterhouse was attracted to the character of the siren for the same reason he was fond of subjects like Circe, Medea, and Lamia \u2013 all they are female characters whose beauty and power symbolize the dangers of femininity. In [i]The Siren[/i], Waterhouse focused on the intense encounter between the sailor and the siren without referencing a specific legend, myth, or literary narrative. This greatly differs from his earlier depiction of sirens in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/ulysses-and-the-sirens-1891][i]Odysseus and the Sirens[/i][/url] (1891), in which the sirens, half woman-half-bird launch a fierce attack on Odysseus\u2019s ship. In [i]Odysseus and the Sirens[/i], the scene suggests a noisy and chaotic environment in which the sirens viciously attack the sailors.  In contrast, [i]The Siren[/i] captures an eerie, quiet atmosphere that emphasizes the tension between the seductress and the sailor, who is potentially her prey. The intimate connection between the siren and the sailor is similar to that between the male and female sitters in Waterhouse\u2019s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/nymphs-finding-the-head-of-orpheus-1900][i]Nymphs Finding the Head of Orpheus[/i][/url] (1900). In this instance, the young nymphs seemed hypnotized by the musician\u2019s head floating in the water. Like [i]The Siren[/i], [i]Nymphs Finding the Head of Orpheus[/i] was probably inspired by the same series of oil sketches and pencil drawings."

After the collector Sergey Shchukin commissioned \"The Dance\", he wrote to Matisse asking for another panel on the subject of music. It is only when seen together that they acquire their full resonance.\r\n\r\nMatisse worked on the huge canvas for \"Music\" without preparatory sketches and rethought the composition numerous times. The canvas thus bears the traces of numerous alterations, and we can almost trace all the steps in the artist's difficult search for the desired effect. Once complete, the central idea of the Shchukin ensemble was man's achievement of a state of completeness through passionate immersion in creativity.\r\n\r\n\"Music\" is built up of the same three elements as \"The Dance\": the same expressive harmony of green, red and blue; the five simplified figures of musicians and singers accord with the five dancers; as in \"The Dance\", Man is one with Earth and Heaven. He has mounted the hill, torn himself away from everyday routine and become an image-symbol, existing outside of time and space. But \"Music\" amazes us with its concentrated calm, the absolute immobility of the isolated figures, the total concentration on the playing of musical instruments and singing. The open mouths seem to resonate and force us to physically experience the human voices pouring from within. Whilst the figures, who seem almost like musical notation on a page, are totally enclosed within themselves, the music unites them in a single whole, the violin-playing conductor acting as the central figure in the composition."

In Hopper's ledger, this location, with its white sand and vivid blue water, is described as having a \"very clean & swept look\" (Artist's ledger, Whitney Museum of American Art). His composition of the Coast Guard station and its landscape is similarly and appropriately clean. The water and the rocks in the foreground are painted in loose, limpid washes of color, and the repeated angles of the station's various gables, punctuated by the slender vertical of the flagpole that rises from its roof, are more tightly delineated. This is a sunny, tranquil landscape whose subject nonetheless alludes to the darker possibilities of dangerous rescues from the ocean. Hopper had worked very little in watercolor before 1923. However, he soon demonstrated a mastery of the medium after his wife Jo, who was also an artist, encouraged him to utilize it for his outdoor studies."

        "description": "In contrast to her earlier series, the Weavers and The Peasant War, Kollwitz's War cycle was intensely personal and reflected her deep opposition to war, according to biographer Martha Kearns. The series of seven prints was a passionate denouncement of war's devastating senselessness and a woman's fury at its consequences. War was a clear expression of Kollwitz's pacifist convictions. Curator Henri\u00ebtte Kets de Vries observes that, unlike in her earlier prints, the raised arms in this series were not used to incite revolution or as symbols of impending death. Instead, Kollwitz used Renaissance iconography to create a protective space or to express grief. In The Parents, Kollwitz aimed to convey the totality of grief.\n\nKollwitz began sketching a memorial to her son Peter in 1914, and the lithographic version of the third print in War was completed in early 1919. Kollwitz continued to refine this work until the final woodcut version was completed in 1922. According to Curator Claire C. Whitner, Kollwitz painstakingly added detail to the parents' clothing while simultaneously obscuring their faces to transform them from portraits to archetypes, creating a powerful testament to parental grief.\n\nAs with her most powerful graphic works, Kollwitz coordinated every element of the composition to embody and illustrate intense emotions, such as the unending, unyielding torment of a parent's grief. The mother's body is completely bent, her form limp and unable to support itself, while the father's kneeling, slightly more erect torso attempts to hold her up but is so consumed by emotion that he cannot face the world around him. The image is spare, and the mother and father are entwined in an embrace that renders them almost indistinguishable from each other. As the only other person able to comprehend the depth of their loss, the mother and father lean into each other for support."

He also traveled to San Francisco, where he took photographs of the city's streets and landmarks. These included the Golden Gate Bridge, the famous suspension bridge that extends more than 4,000 feet across the entrance to the San Francisco Bay. Sheeler executed this painting in early 1955, working from his photographs, at his home in Irvington, New York. His evocation of the bridge is partially abstract, due to its simplified forms, heightened color palette, and extreme viewpoint. In addition, Sheeler may have devised the composition by superimposing two photographic negatives at a slight overlap. Golden Gate conveys the sensation of passing along the bridge, beneath its towers and suspension cables; the further tower rises like a ladder, with its cross-spans suggesting \"rungs\" against an intensely blue sky.\r\n\r\nThis late work by Sheeler is at once a formal experiment, a tribute to a specific landmark, and a more generalized symbol of travel and opportunity. In a letter to Robert Beverly Hale, curator of American paintings at the Metropolitan Museum, Sheeler wrote, \"I hope the title 'Golden Gate' will remain, it conveys my thought. More fluid than if bridge were added, then it would be limited to be the connecting link between two dots on the map. It is an opening to wherever the spectator thinks desirable.\""

This is one of several self-portraits that Reynolds created during his lifetime, revealing the deeply personal and autobiographical way he chose to depict himself. Instead of painting an idealized version of himself, Reynolds provides a realistic portrayal of his hearing loss in his later years.\n\nThis work also showcases Reynolds' mastery of light and shading in portraiture. By using a black background and contrasting it with the light that illuminates his face and hand, Reynolds draws attention to the most significant aspect of the painting - his ear. The piece is imbued with Baroque energy and exemplifies the skilled use of chiaroscuro, demonstrating the influence of artists such as the Italian master Caravaggio on Reynolds' art."

This goal was never realized, but his sharp colors, fantastic imagery, and precise outlines\u2014derived from the style and subject matter of popular print culture\u2014 struck a chord with a younger generation of avant-garde painters, including Pablo Picasso, Vasily Kandinsky, and Frida Kahlo."

It's an ambiguous scene as key details such as road signs are left out - it could be anywhere in the United States. A barbers shop is the only sign of business or even any life within the area. This painting is an example of his striking use of light to create an ethereal mood. It is stark and efficient and conveys a sense of desolation, yet the lighting softens these characteristics."

        "description": "In this painting, most of Kahlo's body is obscured from view. We are unusually confronted with the foot and plug end of the bath, and with focus placed on the artist's feet. Furthermore, Kahlo adopts a birds-eye view and looks down on the water from above. Within the water, Kahlo paints an alternative [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url], one in which the more traditional facial portrait has been replaced by an array of symbols and recurring motifs. The artist includes portraits of her parents, a traditional Tehuana dress, a perforated shell, a dead hummingbird, two female lovers, a skeleton, a crumbling skyscraper, a ship set sail, and a woman drowning. This painting was featured in Breton's 1938 book on [i]Surrealism and Painting[/i] and Hayden Herrera, in her biography of Kahlo, mentions that the artist herself considered this work to have a special importance. Recalling the tapestry style painting of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/northern-renaissance]Northern Renaissance[/url] masters, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch]Hieronymus Bosch[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder]Pieter Bruegel the Elder[/url], the figures and objects floating in the water of Kahlo's painting create an at once fantastic and real landscape of memory.\n\nKahlo discussed [i]What the Water Gave Me[/i] with the Manhattan gallery owner Julien Levy, and suggested that it was a sad piece that mourned the loss of her childhood. Perhaps the strangled figure at the center is representative of the inner emotional torments experienced by Kahlo herself. It is clear from the conversation that the artist had with Levy, that Kahlo was aware of the philosophical implications of her work. In an interview with Herrera, Levy recalls, in 'a long philosophical discourse, Kahlo talked about the perspective of herself that is shown in this painting'. He further relays that 'her idea was about the image of yourself that you have because you do not see your head. The head is something that is looking but is not seen. It is what one carries around to look at life with.' The artist's head in [i]What the Water Gave Me[/i] is thus appropriately replaced by the interior thoughts that occupy her mind. As well as inclusion of death by strangulation in the center of the water, there is also a labia-like flower and a cluster of pubic hair painted between Kahlo's legs. The work is quite sexual while also showing a preoccupation with destruction and death. The motif of the bathtub in art is one that has been popular since [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david]Jacques-Louis David[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/the-death-of-marat-1793][i]The Death of Marat[/i][/url] (1793), and was later taken up many different personalities such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francesca-woodman]Francesca Woodman[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tracey-emin]Tracey Emin[/url]."

During the Renaissance, John\u2019s head on a platter was widely understood to be a symbol for the Host, or sacramental bread in the Christian ritual of the Eucharist. Luini executed several paintings of Salome with the head of the Baptist where the beautiful faces belie the brutal violence of decapitation.

        "description": "Believed to be his last painting, Caravaggio's \"John the Baptist Reclining\" is barely known by comparison to his other pieces. This is due to disputes that arose after Caravaggio's death regarding the attribution of the piece as a work of the great master. The painting was discovered in Argentina; it is now in a private collection in Munich. The reasons for thinking it may be by Caravaggio, apart from the style and subject matter, are as follows: in July 1610, following news of Caravaggio's death, the bishop of Caserta wrote to Cardinal Scipione Borghese that three paintings by the artist were in the Naples palazzo of the Marchesa of Caravaggio. They were two Saint Johns and a Magdalene. The paintings had been intended for Borghese and he instructed the Marchesa to look after them for him. Unfortunately for Borghese they were seized two days later by the head of the Knights of Malta in Naples, on the grounds that Caravaggio was a knight of the Order and all his possessions devolved on the Knights - which all involved must have known to be untrue, as Caravaggio had been expelled from the Order in 1608. The newly arrived Spanish Viceroy of Naples heard of the affair, but, believing the paintings were in Porto Ercole, wrote to the head of the Spanish garrison there telling him that the Knights had no right to them and that they should be returned to the Viceroy, \"in particular the painting of John the Baptist.\" There is no certain knowledge of what happened to the various paintings after that point. Cardinal Borghese got the \u201cYouth with a Ram\u201d, but more than a year later. The other two paintings - the Magdalene and the second Baptist - disappeared, but it is possible, though unproven, that the Viceroy may have managed to secure the other Baptist. He would presumably have taken it back to Spain, and from there it could have made its way to South America. All this, however, is speculation - it needs to be pointed out that no-one knows the exact identity of the paintings involved."

As a Scottish artist, Wilkie was keen to elevate the status of his national school. Here, however, he seems to draw on stereotypes, showing his character with a red nose and cheeks, auburn hair and thick eyebrows. These elements evoke the wildness associated with the Scots by many 19th-century English viewers. While Wilkie\u2019s picture may appear to be taken from life, it also answered a demand for romanticised images of Scotland."

While the scene here could represent a memory of folk festivals or 'festas', it also has a more profound symbolic meaning. The dance can be read as a dance of life, representing the stages from a girl's childhood to old age. The rhythmic movement of the figures contrasts with the stillness of the setting, suggesting the balance between perpetual change and the essential continuity of existence. Rego's painting has an eerie, dream-like quality typical of her work, which often refers to childhood fears and fantasy. The work can be considered a memorial to Rego's husband, the artist Victor Willing, who died during its completion."

Furthermore, the paradoxical situation has arisen, wherein the abundance of information available is merely contributing to our insecurity.

There she met her husband, the artist Otto Modersohn, as well as the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, who became a close companion. Worpswede\u2019s artists were known for their commitment to nature and to positive depictions of the local villagers, but Modersohn-Becker soon grew restless. Between 1900 and her death, in 1907, she made four trips to Paris, studying ancient sculpture and Egyptian mummy portraits at the Louvre and visiting other museums and galleries, all of which profoundly impacted her last great period of work. Best known for penetrating self-portraits, characterized by psychological introspection as well as material and stylistic experimentation, Modersohn-Becker is also thought to be the first woman to paint female nudes.\n\nIn this artwork, painted the year of her death, her masklike visage, combined with the areas of thick paint on her brow and right eyelid, the literal carving of a flower into her cheek (likely done with the end of a brush), and the vivid, expressionistic palette, all mark Modersohn-Becker as a pioneering contemporary of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.\n\n[url href=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/216210]MoMA[/url]"

The sweeping diagonals of the gunwales and the swirling masses of water join with the powerful exultant figures of the men to heighten the movement and excitement of the scene.

Kane was enthralled with plains bison, and he would execute a number of paintings based on the theme.\r\n          This particular painting, which depicts bison being directed into a corral for slaughter, was one of fourteen produced for Sir George Simpson, governor of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company (HBC), who authorized and aided Kane\u2019s travel through HBC territory. Simpson intended to display the paintings in a room he was designing as a \u201cmuseum of Indian curiosities\u201d  and seems to have had a vested interest in the images Kane produced for him. Simpson was not shy about directing the artist on subject matter, advising him that the bison should be depicted in profile so as to \u201cgive a better idea of the appearance of the animals.\u201d  Kane obliged, but the side view from a distant, elevated vantage point also allowed the artist to better distill the essential elements of the event into a pictorial narrative: the stampeding herd is funnelled by Aboriginal men (on horseback and foot) along a narrowing lane into a corral in which another man, perched in a tree, \u201cchants an invocation for the success of the undertaking.\u201d\r\n          Curiously, Kane\u2019s field journal mentions nothing of his witnessing the actual hunt, just the pound containing the aftermath of a previous slaughter. The artist may well have relied on oral accounts of the event. Kane\u2019s painting is a composite based on several sketches\u2014of bison, figures, landscape\u2014and a detailed pencil drawing that corresponds closely to this particular version."

The shining sunny light and the opening of the scene towards the viewer is linked to its intimate character.\n\n[i]The Strange Garden[/i] is decidedly a composition transgressing the category of a portrait depicting the artist\u2019s loved ones. It was painted during his summer holidays in 1902 in Siedlec, a village near Krak\u00f3w, where the artist went with his family. Mehoffer finished it in 1903, as the signature says. During the three subsequent years, it was publicly displayed in Vienna, St. Louis, Chicago, and Munich, where it gained the appreciation of the jurors and official awards.\n\nThe canvas depicts three people: the artist\u2019s wife, his son, and their nanny. The axis of the composition is set by the diagonal created by the alley running into the garden. The figures emerge from the orchard alley shadowed by crowns of apple trees and approach the viewer, stepping into an open clearing dazzling with the sun. The viewer\u2019s attention is drawn by the lit figure of the naked child, cautiously treading on the soft grass, and carrying long peduncles of pink-red hollyhocks. The child is the \u2018guide\u2019 of the walk. The sun-lit boy is gleaming with reflected light exacerbating his childish charm and innocence. He is followed by the mother dressed in an elegant sapphire dress and a hat. Portrayed on the edge of the orchard, she is partially hooded in deep shadow. The lower parts of her dress are lit by the bright sun, the ruckles of the shiny fabrics are glimmering. Her head is raised and slightly tilted and she is looking in the direction or the viewer, or rather her husband, the painter. In her left hand, she holds the abundant ruckles of her dress, and her right hand reaches for a branch thickly covered with fruit. In the background, the viewer can see the nanny, wearing a traditional costume of the region of Krak\u00f3w, and lit by a few rays of sun shining through the crowns of trees. \n\nIn the painting the ambiance of full, hot summer is dominant. It is filled with the lavish green of the trees and grass, colorful flowers, the bright sun, branches sagging under the weight of ripening fruit. The range of colors stretches from green interwoven with brown and dun hues of the trees, through tones of the meadow, to bigger stains of the colors of flowers carried by the boy and radiant garlands fringing the trees. The diversified colors used to depict each figure break the fresh and cheerful tones of nature, yet the entire painting is bonded together by a particular lucidity.\n\nA characteristic feature of the composition is the limited field of view. The viewer looks into the garden from a small distance and cannot see its boundaries. The canvas shows only a fragment of the space which seems tight and framed with amassed greenery. The figures are seen from above, yet this lifted point of view is counterbalanced by the elevation of the landscape in the background. There is an inner rhythm to the painting, peacefully and smoothly dragging the viewer into the depiction, leading his or her look from the subsequent figures and into the shadowed alley. This movement across the diagonal axis is intensified by the flowery garland stretching alongside and the rhythm of tree trunks in the distance.\n\nThis description of the harmonious composition does not include the element disrupting the peace, unfit for the scale and perspective of the depiction. It is the huge dragonfly painted onto the canvas. Although its presence in the garden is only natural, it seems to be a foreign body, unfit for the scenery and the figures (who do not even notice it). Maybe it\u2019s the trace of the painter\u2019s presence. In that context, its appearance and proportions could be explained by a sudden emergence of the insect right before the artist\u2019s eyes while he was looking at his wife and son. It would be a trace of his look. The dragonfly could also be considered an element denuding the conventionality of the depiction. The insect is completely flat and doesn\u2019t fit the painting\u2019s space, which seems to negate the rules of its construction.\n\nMehoffer\u2019s work is surprising primarily due to the juxtaposition of the realistic convention of depiction, marked by the attention paid to detail, meticulously represented greenery or women\u2019s clothing items, with the flat, schematically drawn dragonfly whose form evokes associations with goldsmithing or stained glass. The latter connotation is particularly meaningful, as Mehoffer was gifted in working with stained glass, and much of his major artistic achievements are connected with it. The form of the insect in the painting is noticeably contoured, and the golden filling of the skeleton, abdomen and wings, divided by black lines resembling strips of lead used in stained glass panes, intensifies the effect of weirdness, catching the viewer\u2019s eye. Perhaps the dragonfly signals the presence of the artist also this way. \n\nThe years preceding the creation of the canvas could have lead the artist to paint a work representing fulfillment and peace he was filled with, and summer vacation in a pastoral setting was an excellent opportunity to take up that theme. Scholars emphasize that Mehoffer was already an eminent artist at the time, a member and co-founder of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/society-of-polish-artists-sztuka#!#resultType:masonry]Sztuka[/url], an association of Polish artists, and lecturer at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/jan-matejko-academy-of-fine-arts-krakow-poland#!#resultType:masonry]Krak\u00f3w Academy of Fine Arts[/url]. Moreover, he was happily married to Jadwiga Janakowska, whom he frequently and eagerly portrayed. The painting is thus an expression of the affirmation of life and the pleasures offered by the surrounding world.\n\n[url href=https://culture.pl/en/work/the-strange-garden-jozef-mehoffer][b]By Culture PL[/b][/url]"

        "description": "The painting [i]El Jaleo[/i] (1882) by John Singer Sargent made the artist\u2019s reputation when it was first exhibited at the 1882 Paris Salon. The enormous canvas (237x352 cm) that depicts a flamenco performance became an overnight sensation with French audiences and critics. \n\nThe painting is an example of Hispanism, an intricate 19th-century phenomenon in Europe and the United States that refers to a widespread fascination with everything related to Spanish culture. Hispanism had a pervasive influence in different fields. Some famous examples include literary works by Theophile Gautier and Washington Irving, and George Bizet\u2019s opera [i]Carmen[/i] that premiered in Paris in 1875. However, for Sargent, who spent the autumn of 1879 in Spain, the subject of flamenco was more than a fashion choice. The trip to Spain was a formative experience: he copied works of old Spanish masters at the Prado Museum and made live sketches of folk dancers. While traveling through Southern Spain, he observed flamenco performances and became particularly fond of Andalusian Gypsy music. Thus, the choice of subject for [i]El Jaleo[/i] was likely a combination of the growing market for exotic imagery and the artist\u2019s admiration for Spanish music and dance. \n\nThe title [i]El Jaleo[/i] refers to the uproar during the performance, when the audience encourages the dancers by clapping and chanting over the guitar music. The artist painted [i]El Jaleo[/i] three years after his trip to Spain in a studio in France with the help of professional models, costumes and props. Even though Sargent's models were neither dancers nor Spaniards, the artist used his memories and knowledge of flamenco to capture an authentic atmosphere of dynamic performance. In this painting, the arrangement of figures conforms to the traditional presentation of flamenco. The performance is set on a small stage, and the dancer has other performers behind her in a line or a semicircle, leaving her little room to move. This setting also allows the musicians to follow the tempo set by the dancer as they play the accompanying music. \n\nIn producing [i]El Jaleo[/i] Sargent worked methodically to achieve the spontaneity and drama of flamenco. He created many sketches and also the preparatory painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/the-spanish-dancer-study-for-el-jaleo-1882][i]Spanish Dancer[/i][/url] (1882). The dancer\u2019s contorted pose is one of the most complex elements, that demonstrates the mastery of the flamenco technique and style. In the same way, the sketch [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/head-and-hands-of-seated-musicians-study-for-el-jaleo-1880][i]Head and hands of seated musicians[/i][/url] (1888) is part of the preliminary studies for the singer on the dancer\u2019s right.  The singer is caught amid a moving performance with his mouth wide open and his head thrown back. \n\nAfter the Salon in Paris, [i]El Jaleo[/i] was sold to Thomas Jefferson Coolidge, a retired American diplomat. In 1914, Coolidge gave the painting to his good friend Isabella Stewart Gardner - a leading American art collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts. The painting was the centerpiece of the music room at the Gardener home in Boston, and today it remains in the city hanging at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum."

        "description": "[i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i], Jan Vermeer\u2019s most famous painting, is often called the \u2018Dutch Mona Lisa\u2019. The comparison to Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/mona-lisa][i]Mona Lisa[/i][/url] (ca. 1504) makes sense: both paintings share an air of mystery, from the model\u2019s enigmatic gaze to the speculations surrounding the identities of the women in the paintings. The identity of the model in [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] remains unknown. Some have suggested that it is Vermeer\u2019s eldest daughter, Maria, however there is no compelling evidence to confirm this assertion.\n\nThe painting is considered a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/tronie#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]tronie[/url], a subcategory of portraiture that was popular in the Dutch Golden Age and Flemish [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Baroque[/url] art. Tronies are studies of facial characteristics, stereotypical characters or exaggerated expressions. Vermeer captures a fleeting moment, the girl turning her head, her lips slightly parted while she directly faces the viewer. The girl wears a head wrap inspired by a Turkish turban and an enormous pearl earring. These exotic elements increase the drama of the painting, and give the artist the opportunity to display artistic effects in his treatment of light and texture. Another tronie by Vermeer, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/study-of-a-young-woman][i]Study of A Young Woman[/i][/url] (ca. 1665-1667) is often seen as a variant or counterpart of [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i]. In both paintings, the figures are set against a black background, wearing the pearl earring and having a scarf draped over the shoulder. While [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] is an idealized beauty, the [i]Study of A Young Woman[/i] shows plain and imperfect facial features.\n\nEven though [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] is consistent with Vermeer\u2019s style and technique, it is distinct in a few noteworthy ways. Vermeer used his inventive method of layering paint that created the sensuality of the soft skin. This was accomplished by layering a thin flesh-colored glaze over a transparent under-modelling (the initial layers of color placed on the surface). Some have suggested that Vermeer was able to capture these details and effects through the use of [i]camera obscura[/i], an optical device that was able to project an image onto a flat surface. Vermeer employed this technique in other paintings, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/woman-holding-a-balance-1665][i]Woman Holding a Balance[/i][/url] (1665) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/young-woman-with-a-water-pitcher][i]Young Woman with a Water Pitcher[/i][/url] (ca. 1662-1665). In both cases, Vermeer used this technique of layering paint when creating the shaded portions of the headdress on the models.  However, in [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i], the application of paint is bolder and more expressive. In a 1994 restoration, it was discovered that Vermeer accentuated girl\u2019s mouth with small dots of pink paint, and placed light accents in her eyes to brighten her face. The model is set against a dark background, which is very different than the detailed settings of Vermeer\u2019s interior paintings, such as the mentioned [i]Woman Holding a Balance[/i] and [i]Young Woman with a Water Pitcher[/i]. In the interior settings, the women are portrayed in contemplative and quiet moments, while [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] has a sense of immediacy and drama. The painting has a timeless quality, the girl bears no symbolic attributes, and she is not placed in any specific context. For this reason, she has captured the imagination of viewers throughout generations."

        "description": "This portrait of a pastry cook was the decisive moment in Soutine\u2019s career. Paul Guillaume, who was at that time looking for works by Modigliani, discovered Soutine through Michel Georges-Michel, a writer and art critic who had written an article on the painter. Then, in 1923, Paul Guillaume described the painting that he had acquired, in his review Les Arts \u00e0 Paris, and which appears to be the one in the Barnes Foundation Collection in the United States: \u201can extraordinary, fascinating, real, and truculent pastry cook, afflicted with an immense and magnificent ear, surprising and just right: a masterpiece. So I bought it. Barnes saw it at my place, and cried \"It's a peach!\" The spontaneous pleasure he derived from this canvas would immediately change Soutine's fortunes, transforming him overnight into a recognised painter, sought after by patrons, and an artist to be taken seriously - a hero in Montparnasse.\" Soutine, who often worked in series, produced six versions of this same subject that we know of today. Paul Guillaume bought this painting in the early 1930s in memory of the first Pastry Cook that he had liked so much. This extremely accomplished version in the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie presents a model with an elongated face and fragile neck, wearing his pastry chef hat and jacket. His facial features and limbs are distorted, giving the painting a strong expressive power. The cloth he is holding, expressed in a flat, vivid red, contrasts with the surface of his clothes, rendered in white with touches of grey and green. The model\u2019s pose could have been inspired by one of the paintings in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Jean Fouquet\u2019s Portrait de Charles VII [Portrait of Charles VII].[url href=https://www.musee-orangerie.fr/en/artworks/le-petit-patissier-196563]Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie[/url]"

It instead illustrates the unclean walls, bored look on the face of the laying woman, and the disheveled hair of the curious boy. As Courbet used actual figures for his paintings, it is said that the two women in the painting are his two sisters Zoe and Juliet, and the boy is actually his illegitimate son, Desire Binet. It was first exhibited in 1855 at the Salon of Paris, and later in 1861, when it was purchased for the Musee des Beaux-Arts of Nantes.  "

The discovery of a whole collection of these self-composed songs in an old suitcase after Sekoto\u2019s death, led to the production of a musical CD titled \u2018The Blue Heads\u2019 by The Sekoto Foundation under the guidance of Barbara Lindop. Paris, the \u201cCity of Light\u201d, was a beacon of artistic freedom from the early 1920\u2019s and lured thousands of artists, musicians and writers, many of whom were political or cultural exiles, to experience its cordial racial and artistic climate. Sekoto was one of these cultural asylum-seekers having left South Africa under self-imposed exile in 1947. Handicapped by being black, poor and not knowing the language or culture \u2013 an unknown artist painting in a cold, dark hotel room \u2013 Sekoto\u2019s first years in Paris were a battle for survival.\r\n\r\nFollowing World War II Boulevard St Germain, located on the Left Bank, across the Seine from the Tuileries, rivaled Boulevard Montparnasse as the intellectual center of Paris. There are few countries in the world to rival France in its respect for Jazz musicians and Jazz as an art form. By virtue of this, Sekoto was able to find employment at l\u2019Echelle de Jacob (Jacob\u2019s ladder) \u2013 one of Paris\u2019 trendy nightclubs at the time \u2013 when the owner heard him play the piano at an audition he had stumbled upon. By using thick impasto brushstrokes to accentuate the rhythmic composition of angular shapes, Sekoto creates a visual beat in \u2018Jazz Band\u2019. His palette is dominated by grey and blue hues, recreating the smoky haze of the underground nightclub scene. The tight composition echoes the confined cellar space, and draws the viewer in as if seated at a table, nodding approvingly while listening to the live music.\r\n\r\nCommenting on this painting, Sekoto said: I played for a students\u2019 caf\u00e9, then various other bars where the clients had more money and where the French and tourists paid more. This is one of the St Germain nightclub cellars. The players are not my pals nor was the picture done on the spot . (Bibliography: Barbara Lindop, Gerard Sekoto , Randburg, 1988, pp 31 and 237)"

He lived in Rome from 1832 to 1848, but often returned to Venice, depicting both cities in vivid colors and shifting light. The present work can be dated to around 1839-1840.

On the other hand, recording the site, on Long Island's north shore near Huntington in Suffolk County, would have required perhaps an hour's sail or less across the Long Island Sound from Kensett's studio off Darien, Connecticut. Like virtually all the paintings found in the studio at the artist's death in 1872, Eaton's Neck is unsigned and undated, and its state of completion is, at best, ambiguous. Kensett, for instance, worked the shoreline foliage into a state of finish comparable to works that he signed and sold, but the apparent sailboats punctuating the distant horizon are plotted without being fully articulated, as they are in finished works. Still, given the reductive character of almost all Kensett's late paintings, this synthesis of uninflected land, water, and sky engages the spectator equally with, if not more than, any in the same gallery by the artist or his Hudson River School colleagues."

I drew him twice sitting in a padded armchair and asked him to come again two or three times so that I could make a few small paintings of him wearing his naval uniform. The meetings resulted in the paintings \"Sailor in an armchair with a pink face\" and \"Sailor in an armchair with a yellowish face\". This is how the sailor entered my repertoire.

        "description": "Critical notes:\n\nFor Pellizza from the 1990s onwards it is the light of the Volpedo landscape, the centre of his inner microcosm, that generates the symbolism of the painting. \"On the Barn is a clear demonstration of this. At the end of summer 1892, looking at the barn in the shade in front of his studio and beyond it the sun-drenched countryside, he thought of contrasting the end of life with the perpetually regenerated nature. Thus was born this work, one of his masterpieces. \"It was supposed to be a rough story\", writes Pellizza. A farm worker with no home or family, taken ill, is ending his days on the straw of a barn. The genesis of the painting passes through several drawings and two oil studies entitled \"Christian Charity\". The change of title, as always with Pellizza, corresponds to a maturation of the subject: the definitive title strips the work of any pathetic implications. \"On the Barn\" is a meditation on death without ideological or religious superstructures. Behind it, as the drama unfolds, the small green and yellow touches of vegetation and the reassuring geometries of the houses reaffirm the continuity of life. From the backlighting of the foreground to the intense luminosity of the wings, a vitalism asserts itself that owes nothing to the Catholic faith, but seems closer to the myth of the eternal return expressed by Nietzsche in Cos\u00ec parl\u00f2 Zaratustra.\n\n(source: Information sheet on the exhibition Divisionism. The revolution of light cited above) \n\nPrepared at length during 1892, Sul fienile (On the Barn) was executed during 1893 and exhibited in Milan in 1894, but then taken up again in 1895. Together with the almost contemporary Procession, it was the first painting in which Pellizza sought to meticulously apply Divisionism. Set in the old porch of his house, On the Barn reveals a scrupulous attention to reality.\nThe painter himself, aware of the importance of this work in his creative process, indicated it as the real beginning of a new pictorial phase, attentive to social themes and capable of establishing a closer relationship with reality thanks to the use of the new technique. He was thus able to effectively communicate his way of feeling and dealing with reality using new, scientifically exact techniques, through the representation of the ...eternal contrast between life and death... a serf who leaves home to earn bread for his family with a pickaxe and a spade and is reduced to dying far from home on the barn - the priest gives him a viaticum... The gold medal won in Munich in 1901 confirmed Pellizza's faith in his work.\n\n(source: Aurora Scotti, Pellizza da Volpedo. Catalogo generale, Milan 1986, card 799 [abridged text])"

The large features, full cheeks, and big, almond-shaped eyes on the wide, modeled face resemble the countenances on frescoes in the Chapel of the Theotokos on the island of Patmos. The icon is even closer in style to the murals of the Church of the Transfiguration of the Saviour on Nereditsa in Novgorod (1199), where it may have been part of the deisus tier on the altar screen. \n\nThe distinct feature of this icon is the hair of the angel, made in the [i]assisto[/i] technique of gold leaf, which gave the name [i]The Angel with Golden Hair[/i].

Picasso produced between sixty and seventy preparatory works and postscripts to [i]Guernica[/i]. Of the subjects he explored the most frequently depicted image is that of a single female head, bearing an expression of anguish and engulfed in tears. There has been traced thirty-six unique works depicting such images, executed between May and the end of October 1937: 9 paintings on canvas, 21 drawings on paper or card, and 6 small drawings on matchboxes.\n\nThe \u2018architecture\u2019 of the woman's face in [i]Weeping Woman[/i] is, however, very different from the flat outlined faces of [i]Guernica[/i].

        "description": "This work is one of the mysteries of European painting: in spite of its undeniable quality and epochal importance, opinions are divergent concerning both its creator and its theme. It is the outstanding masterpiece of the Venetian Renaissance, the summit of Giorgione's creative career, so much so that according to some it may have been painted, or at least finished, by Titian rather than Giorgione.\r\n\r\nThe painting has been interpreted as an allegory of Nature, similar to Giorgione's Storm, which was undeniably painted by him; it was even viewed as the first example of the modern herdsman genre. Its message must be more complex than this. It is likely that the master consciously unified several themes in this painting, and the deciphering of symbols required a degree of erudition even at the time of its creation. During the eighteenth century the painting was known by the simple name of \"Pastorale\" and only subsequently was it given the title \"F\u00eate champ\u00eatre\" or \"Concert champ\u00eatre\", owing to its festive mood. Modern research has pointed out that the composition is in fact an allegory of poetry.\r\n\r\nThe female figures in the foreground are probably the Muses of poetry, their nakedness reveals their divine being. The standing figure pouring water from a glass jar represents the superior tragic poetry, while the seated one holding a flute is the Muse of the less prestigious comedy or pastoral poetry. The well-dressed youth who is playing a lute is the poet of exalted lyricism, while the bareheaded one is an ordinary lyricist. The painter based this differentiation on Aristotle's \"Poetica\".\r\n\r\nThe scenery is characterized by a duality. Between the elegant, slim trees on the left, we see a multi-levelled villa, while on the right, in a lush grove, we see a shepherd playing a bagpipe. Yet the effect is completely unified. The very presence of the beautiful, mature Muses provides inspiration; the harmony of scenery and figures, colours and forms proclaims the close interrelationship between man and nature, poetry and music."

The model for the picture, Mistinguett, was a successful actress and singer, and was one of Picabia's first famous friends from the entertainment industry (she was at one time the lover of Maurice Chevalier). Independently wealthy, Picabia enjoyed the life of the bon viveur and was often drawn to music halls, nightclubs, circuses, and the cinema. He met Mistinguett during one of his visits to the Parisian revues. Instead of painting a realistic portrayal of her, he was much more interested in revealing the mood of the time by using dramatic color and composition. - See more at: http://www.theartstory.org/artist-picabia-francis.htm#sthash.xchIYynP.dpuf"

The subject was anachronistic, as the Scots were not doing cattle raids in the 1850s and 1860s; this practice was dropped a hundred years before. But the subject gave Bonheur an excellent opportunity to show all types of hurting animals: goats, cows of different races, colors, and textures of the fur. \n\nThe excellent study of the anatomy that distinguished the Bonheur's painting emerges in every subject of the work, combined with an extraordinary setting and clever use of [i]chiaroscuro[/i]. The steep nature of the land allows the artist to play with the background environment and open, on the left, a patch of the rough sea under the stormy, leaden sky, crossed by clear sun rays, as is typical of the Scottish imaginary. The men are silhouetted in the running, as the real protagonists here are the living beings unable to communicate but through the power of the muscles, the forced and restless poses. Three bulls in the front row look at the observer to involve him in work. The black bull, a powerful, attentive one, is the center of the painting. He serves as an axis of symmetry to the picture through the outstretched ears, and the fixed gaze searching our attention. Further to the right, a light bull with a raised hoof shows itself in profile as it scans the sea, perhaps in search of an escape route. Each animal is not only physically described, but also has a unique kind of emotional quality."

        "description": "[i]Christ among the Doctors[/i] (1506) was executed by Albrecht D\u00fcrer during his second trip to Italy. The panel depicts an episode from the life of Christ - at age twelve, young Jesus goes along with Joseph and Mary on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Jesus lingers at the temple and is later found in discussion with the elders of the temple. The painting contains a Latin inscription, located on a page slip in the book held by the elder on the left: [i]Opus quinque dierum[/i], meaning \u201cwork executed in five days\u201d. Scholars agree that this refers to the swift execution of the painting, which has a base of tempera and a thin coat of oil paint.\n\n[i]Christ among the Doctors[/i] is not only distinct in the context of D\u00fcrer\u2019s work, but also generally it resembles few other paintings from the period. The artist conceives an overcrowded and dense composition, dominated by a pattern of hands, heads and books. This density and lack of space is reminiscent of the late work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch]Hieronymus Bosch[/url] and his followers, in paintings such as: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/christ-crowned-with-thorns-1510][i]Christ Crowned with Thorns[/i][/url] (ca. 1510),[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/the-carrying-of-the-cross-1480] [i]Christ Carrying the Cross[/i][/url] (ca. 1510) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/christ-before-pilate-1516][i]Christ before Pontius Pilate[/i][/url] (ca. 1520). The painting is also relatively flat, which, given D\u00fcrer\u2019s interest and knowledge of the art of perspective, should be understood as an intentional artistic choice. This is evident when comparing the painting to D\u00fcrer\u2019s earlier depictions of the theme, in one of the panels of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/the-seven-sorrows][i]The Seven Sorrows of the Virgin[/i][/url] (1494-1497), and in the woodcut from the series [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/all-works#!#filterName:Series_life-of-the-virgin,resultType:masonry][i]Life of the Virgin[/i][/url] (1503). In both instances, the artist depicts the figures in full within a spacious interior.\n\nIn [i]Christ among the Doctors[/i], D\u00fcrer successfully combines elements of Italian and Northern European painting. The composition was likely inspired by the Venetian type half-length picture. For example, D\u00fcrer\u2019s painting is similar in arrangement to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/cima-da-conegliano/christ-among-the-doctors-1504][i]Christ among the Doctor\u2019s[/i][/url] (1504) by Italian Renaissance painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/cima-da-conegliano]Cima da Conegliano[/url]. However, the solemn and quiet mood of Cima\u2019s painting is very different from the tense and dynamic atmosphere created by D\u00fcrer. D\u00fcrer builds a dramatic conflict by contrasting the youth and beauty of Christ with the ugliness and old age of the Jewish rabbis. The grotesque heads of the Jewish rabbis draw from the tradition of northern grotesque iconography. Here once again, Bosch is an important influence. In paintings such as the abovementioned [i]Christ Crowned with Thorns[/i], Christ\u2019s enemies are modeled in a similar style. In addition, many have cited [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci]Leonardo Da Vinci[/url]\u2019s drawings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_caricature,resultType:masonry]grotesque heads[/url] as a possible influence. \n\nIn the painting, D\u00fcrer used variation to express ugliness and deformity, in order to introduce different symbols of evil. The two faces on the left fall under the category Durer called \u2018[i]B\u00e4urisch Gestalt[/i]\u2019, which referred to brutish, peasant-like figures. The left upper figure\u2019s eyes are covered by a hat, symbolizing the blindness of the Synagogue. The bearded figure in the forefront represents ugliness through the emphasis on old age. The central figure that touches Jesus introduces another type of ugliness, which is expressed through the abnormality of his features. Finally, the two figures in the background embody the idea of the \u2018evil eye\u2019, a type of evil that seems to possess a demonic power. "

        "description": "In 1940, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York commissioned Orozco to paint the mural [i]Dive Bomber and Tank[/i] (1940) for the important exhibition [i]Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art[/i]. This indicated the growing interest and emphasis placed on mural painting in the context of Mexican art. The mural was painted in the hall of the Museum over a short period of ten days. Orozco painted most of the mural in front of the public, making it a performance of sorts.\n\n[i]Dive Bomber and Tank[/i] represents the wreckage and destruction of modern warfare: from the top center of the painting, there is a tail of a fallen plane, an element that stands out because of its red color. Large structures resembling wings emerge from the central wreckage, while tank tracks appear on the lower left. In the large pile of machinery, viewers can identify human remains like the legs pointing out on the right side of the mural, and the three large masklike faces pierced by spikes and tangled in chains on the lower half of the mural. The painting serves as a universal message against violence. Some have suggested that Orozco emulated the model set by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-silvers/guernica-photomosaic-mounted-on-aluminum][i]Guernica[/i][/url] (1937), which at the time was exhibited at the MoMA as part of its American tour. Picasso\u2019s monumental painting became a representative example of the aesthetic of a modernist painting that addressed social and political themes in the late 1930s. Painted in 1940, during World War II, Orozco\u2019s imagery refers to the current events of the time. The artist however insisted that the mural was not a political statement and said: \u201cI simply paint the life that is going on at the present\u2014what we are and what the world is at this moment. That is what modern art is.\u201d\n\nThe mural is made up of six portable fresco panels that are meant to be interchangeable. At first, Orozco struggled with the idea of a portable fresco, complaining that frescos are too delicate to be moved. The decision to divide the mural into six panels was based on practical reasons, the museum wanted the exhibition to travel, and portable panels were a suitable solution. In the August 1940 issue of the MoMA Bulletin, Orozco suggested six distinct arrangements for the presentation of the mural. Some of these configurations create more abstract compositions, which result in a more ambiguous image than the standard arrangement. The different arrangements of the mural create multiple meanings, which the artist explained in the Bulletin: \u201cThe order of inter-relationships may stay the same in any other order, and unexpected and expected possibilities may appear. Suppose we change the actual order of the plastic vaults in the Sistine Chapel\u2026\u201d The art historian, James Oles explains that the stylistic and physical fragmentation in the fresco serves as an allegory for the fragmentation of war. Accordingly, Orozco\u2019s apocalyptic image can be understood as a general condemnation of violence caused by war."

He began experimenting with Neo-Impressionism and by 1885 had adopted the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pointillism]Pointillist[/url] technique, becoming one of the first artists to do so. The shimmering effect of the subtle gold arabesques in the wallpaper, the blue flower, and the touches of color in her white dress convey a sense of wealth and elegance, yet the woman seems static as if her figure was meant to be the decorative element of the room."

        "description": "[i]Zebra and Parachute[/i] is one of Wood\u2019s last paintings. The image brings together an unusual collection of elements that give the work a surrealist flavour. A zebra appears against the backdrop of a modernist building. The animal stands on the building\u2019s roof terrace near a raised flowerbed. The distinctive lines of the architecture, which include strong diagonals produced by a zig-zagging ramp and the cylindrical forms of two chimneys or towers in the background, suggest an almost abstract arrangement that contrasts with the altogether different pattern produced by the zebra\u2019s stripes. A dark shadow falls just in front of the zebra, casting the right-hand zone of the terrace into semi-darkness and adding to the mysterious atmosphere of the image. In the sky above this scene, a parachute is descending. The tiny figure that dangles in the parachute harness appears limp and lifeless. \n\nThe distinctive architecture of the building in [i]Zebra and Parachute[/i] identifies it as the Villa Savoye, near Paris, designed by Le Corbusier. The villa, begun in 1928, was finished in 1931, and construction was well underway at the time Wood produced this painting. In the context of this work the Villa Savoye\u2019s modernism suggests civilization and the zebra is a signifier of the exotic. \n\nWood was staying in Paris when he painted in [i]Zebra and Parachute[/i]. Along with this work, he produced at the same time the closely related painting, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/christopher-wood/tiger-and-arc-de-triomphe-1930][i]Tiger and Arc de Triomphe[/i][/url]. In it, he set up a similar juxtaposition of the exotic and the man-made as that produced in [i]Zebra and Parachute[/i], this time placing a lazily sprawling tiger and a sitting leopard against a wooded background with a view of the Arc de Triomphe monument behind them. Both paintings are reminiscent of the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-rousseau]Henri Rousseau[/url], known particularly for the depiction of animals in jungle settings in a na\u00efve style. The parachute is perhaps evocative of Rousseau\u2019s late landscape painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-rousseau/view-of-the-bridge-at-sevres-and-the-hills-at-clamart-st-cloud-and-bellevue-1908][i]View of the of the Bridge at S\u00e8vres and the Hills of Clamart, St Cloud and Bellevue[/i][/url], which includes in the sky a biplane, a hot-air balloon and an airship. In [i]Zebra and Parachute[/i], the effect of strong shadow cast across a built environment resonates with the work the Italian painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-de-chirico]Giorgio de Chirico[/url], with whose art Wood was familiar. \n\nThe surrealist aspects of [i]Zebra and Parachute[/i] and [i]Tiger and Arc de Triomphe[/i] suggest that Wood was striking off in a new direction at this point in his career. However, he tragically died on his return to England. Suffering the effects of opium withdrawal, which produced feelings of being pursued, he threw himself under a train at Salisbury station."

        "description": "The painting [i]The Murder of Andreas Baader[/i] (1977-1978) is one of Odd Nerdrum\u2019s most notable early works. The scene depicted by the Norwegian painter refers to the death of Andreas Baader, one of the founders of the Baader-Meinhof group, a far left militant organization. The group was responsible for numerous crimes, including murder and kidnapping, which resulted in the imprisonment and conviction of the group\u2019s leadership. In an attempt to negotiate their release, other members kidnapped the businessman and industrialist, Hanns Martin Schleyer, and hijacked a Lufthansa plane in Somalia. On the night of October 17, 1977, the state ran a successful operation and was able to recover control of the hijacked plane. The next morning, three of the convicted leaders, including Andreas Baader, were found dead in their cells and the fourth was injured with multiple stab wounds. The German authorities reported the incidents as suicides, however many speculated that the prisoners were murdered by the state. Nerdrum\u2019s painting adopts the unofficial version, depicting an execution sanctioned by the state.\n\nNerdrum modeled the painting after [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] masterpiece, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/crucifixion-of-saint-peter-1601][i]Crucifixion of St. Peter[/i][/url] (1601). The main points of comparison between the two paintings are the dramatic composition and the use of [i]chiaroscuro[/i] - a term that refers to strong contrasts between light and dark. It has a symbolic function in Carvaggio\u2019s [i]Crucifixion of St. Peter[/i]: the saint being bound to the cross is in the light, while his assailants are in the shadows and depicted from the back. Nerdrum adopts these characteristics: the victim bathes in light while the perpetrators are largely in the shadows or facing away from the viewer. The greatest contrast is between Baader, naked and beaten, and the figure of the executioner, emerging from the dark, coldly pointing a gun at Baader\u2019s head.\n\nNerdrum\u2019s painting drew controversy in Norway and Germany, as the public was still reeling from the traumatic events of the \u201cGerman Autumn\u201d. At the time, Nerdrum\u2019s politics were largely formed by anarchist views, and he was sympathetic toward Baader as an uncompromising and tragic idealist. The depiction of Baader as a martyr caused public outrage, but at the same time it opened up space for important discussion and critique. [i]The Murder of Andreas Baader[/i] challenged the credibility of state authority, and critiqued the contemporary world and the modern state. For Nerdrum, modern societies embrace values of benevolence and kindness but in the shadows use brutality and violence. \n\nThe depiction of Baader as a martyr of state tyranny is characteristic for this period in Nerdrum\u2019s career. Many of Nerdrum\u2019s early paintings focused on human suffering, particularly figures at the fringes of society, losers and underdogs that are either ignored or victimized by society. This is the common theme of paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/morning][i]Morning[/i][/url] (1972-1973) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/abandoned-1978][i]Abandoned[/i][/url] (1977-1978). Even though these paintings focus on a single figure unlike [i]Murder of Andreas Baader[/i], they share the negative attitude toward the state and modern society."

In 1813 he produced several oil studies and finished paintings, possibly including this one, of horses at the Imperial stables at Versailles. These paintings demonstrate close observation and detailed naturalism.\n\nIn this picture, we see a fine thoroughbred. G\u00e9ricault has shown the moment it reacts to a bolt of lightning (in the upper right corner), and presumably, the accompanying clap of thunder. He avoided the more dramatic, and perhaps rather clich\u00e9d, image of a horse rearing, instead of showing the animal in profile as it freezes in fear.\n\nG\u00e9ricault brilliantly captured the sheen of the dappled coat as it is momentarily lit up against the near blackness of the night sky. Using short, staccato strokes of liquid paint, which precisely follow the contours of the horse's body, he created an effect of nervous energy that ripples across its silky surface."

Renoir often included his friends and acquaintances in his paintings, and this one is no different.

        "description": "In the second plate of her War series, Kollwitz depicts young boys driven by patriotism and a sense of duty volunteering for battle. With a graphic woodcut style, she prioritizes figural movement over detail, emphasizing the collective solidarity of the soldiers. The boys form a curve that rises from the bottom right to the top left, propelled by their convictions. They sing with their mouths open and arms clasped around each other, while one boy beats a drum to lead them forward. However, Kollwitz foreshadows the tragedy to come by hollowing out their faces with thick strokes, presciently evoking the skeletons they will become. The drummer, whose call to join the war beats louder than all, has already transformed into the specter of death, and the open mouths of two boys in song become a scream of terror in a third.\n\nKollwitz identifies each of the soldiers by name as her son Peter's friends, who were killed during the First World War in the second state of the print. By choosing to place the central figure, with an optimistic glow on his face, at the image's center, the artist highlights the tragedy of the young men's innocence, who gave up their lives for what they believed was a greater cause. Kollwitz chose to emphasize the personal, emotional, and psychological consequences of conflict on those who participated and those left behind in War. By doing so, Kollwitz sought to give universal importance to Peter's death and promote public causes through her personal loss, which came to be intimately intertwined. Similarly to her contemporaries, Otto Dix and Francisco Goya, Kollwitz critiqued war from her own experience."

        "description": "Odd Nerdrum\u2019s painting [i]Dawn[/i] (1990) is emblematic of his style and aesthetic. [i]Dawn[/i] is an example of the imaginary world the artist projects in his paintings: in this case, it is a bleak and barren landscape populated by four figures. The artist presents a surreal scene: four male figures, identical in appearance, are seated turned sideways with their mouths gaping. Even though they are a group, these figures do not relate to each other. Nerdrum repeats this scheme in other paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/wanderers-by-the-sea][i]Wanderers by the Sea[/i][/url] (2001), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/dust-lickers-2005][i]Dust Lickers[/i][/url] (2005) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/limbo][i]Limbo[/i][/url] (2006). In [i]Dawn[/i], the mysterious nature of the painting is enhanced by the strange garments. For instance, the figures upper limbs are restricted by the black cloaks that cover the top halves of their bodies.\n\nThe figures in Dawn inhabit a barren environment - the landscape is a kind of wasteland, scarce in resources. Nerdrum based it on landscape studies during his multiple trips to Iceland. While the landscape has a strong sense of realism, it is a mythical space that represents a place beyond reality. This kind of landscape is recurring in Nerdrum\u2019s paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/woman-kills-injured-man][i]Woman Kills Injured Man[/i][/url] (1994), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/the-night-guard][i]The Night Guard[/i][/url] (1986-1988), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/twins-by-the-sea-1999][i]Twins by the Sea[/i][/url] (1999) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/lunatics-2001][i]Lunatics[/i][/url] (2001). The artist created a world which is a far cry from modern life and society. The figures in [i]Dawn[/i] represent human suffering: they are physically restrained and their screams are mute. They live in a world of scarce resources and are left to their own devices: there are no institutions to clothe, feed, school, house or provide for them in old age. It is a surreal scene, a synthesis of fantasy and reality that expresses feelings of isolation and alienation.  \n\nPaintings like [i]Dawn[/i] stood out at a time when contemporary art was dominated by abstract and conceptual art. Nerdrum focused on traditional craftsmanship, drawing inspiration from Old Masters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url]. Later in 1998, Nerdrum articulated his artistic point of view in his manifesto [i]On Kitsch[/i]. Tradition is at the center of Nerdrum\u2019s art: he embraces the craftsmanship of traditional European painting, as well as the dramatic and emotionally charged qualities of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] art. The artist understands [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/kitsch#!#resultType:masonry][i]kitsch[/i][/url] in a positive light, as an artistic device that through narrative and sentiment portrays the human experience. In the contemporary and postmodern context, [i]kitsch[/i] becomes an avant-garde form of expression. \n\nDawn was purchased by music legend David Bowie in the autumn of 1990. The painting intrigued the musician so much that it was reported that he especially met with Nerdrum to discuss the symbolism behind it. After Bowie\u2019s death in 2016, the painting was auctioned at Sotheby\u2019s. Surpassing estimates, [i]Dawn[/i] was sold for a record price of \u20a4341,000. [i]Dawn[/i] also holds a special place in popular culture: the painting was recreated in Tarsem Singh\u2019s science fiction horror film [i]The Cell[/i] (2000)."

        "description": "Freud painted many portraits of famous people throughout his career. The Queen is perhaps his most powerful and globally recognizable subject. While Freud normally worked large, this composition measures approximately nine and a half by six inches, making it one of his smallest paintings. Nonetheless, it depicts the British monarch as an imposing presence. The entire composition is filled by her face. A sliver of pearls adorns her throat, while atop her white hair is an elaborate, jeweled crown. The symmetrical details in the jewels and hair mark the parameters of the picture, and serve as a kind of psychic boundary for the work. The crown, an item Freud specifically requested she wear for the portrait, dominates the upper border of the picture.\n\nAfter agreeing to pose for the artist, the Queen met Freud for a sitting in May of 2000. Making an exception from his usual practice of making a studio appointment, Freud traveled for sittings to St. James Palace at the Royal Collection's Friary Court, where she sat for him at the picture conservation studio. The small canvas took over six months to complete and was finally finished in December of 2001. By the time he was ready to paint the crown the Queen, who had other obligations, had run out of time. So a model had to be used. Freud, always a lightning rod for controversy, was accused of painting the Queen in an unflattering and unduly harsh light.\n\nThe project sparked debate and got mixed reviews (some saw it as a cheap publicity stunt by an artist with fading talent). Yet in his forthright observation of the Queen's features, one sees a raw intensity Freud had maintained throughout his career and refused to minimize, regardless of his subject. Among the more intriguing interpretations of this portrait, recently discussed by independent art historian Simon Abrahams, is that the Queen is a symbolic stand-in for the artist himself, a kind of alter-ego. The Queen's aging features in this portrait are remarkably similar to those of Freud himself, and the British press complained that the portrait looked nothing like her, adding credence to the theory."

Such unsanctified nudes provoked much discussion about flaws in Courbet's character and art, but the artist reveled in the added attention and increased reputation as a confrontational artist.\r\nIn the 1860\u2019s Courbet began painting erotic nudes scenes, including depictions of female genitalia, nude women in erotic poses, and this painting, depicting lesbianism. Courbet gained much notoriety for his erotic nudes, which he displayed alongside hunting scenes, ensuring a sales and a reputation. Le Sommeil was commissioned by the Turkish diplomat Khalil Bey, who also commissioned The Origin of the World, to include his private collection of erotic paintings. This particular painting was also part of a police report in 1872 when a painting dealer held in it an exhibition. It was not allowed to be displayed publicly until 1988. "

Standing on a bearskin rug of the same color, she holds a white flower at her side while gazing off into the distance, giving her a doll-like appearance. In this piece, Whistler prioritizes exploring tonal variations over accurate portraiture, using the canvas as a medium for this purpose. He renames the painting Symphony in White, No.1: The White Girl, highlighting the varying tones of white in the work and comparing them to musical notes.\n\nThis painting marks Whistler's first successful work, having been rejected by London's Royal Academy and the French Academy's Salon due to its controversial subject matter, which hinted at the loss of innocence. The painting made its debut in the 1863 Salon des Refus\u00e9s, where it was greatly admired by figures such as \u00c9douard Manet, Gustave Courbet, and Charles Baudelaire. Symphony in White represents Whistler's transition from imitating Courbet's realism to developing his own unique abstract style that focused on utilizing subtle color variations, texture, and precise shapes to convey a mood that would evoke sensations in the viewer."

A complex work of Biblical art, featuring 45 enamelled copper plaques decorated with scenes from the Old and New Testaments, it exemplifies his mastery of champlev\u00e9 enamelling, a technique in which compartments hollowed out of a metal base are filled with coloured vitreous enamel. Similar to the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral, figures appearing in the scenes have individualized faces and intricately articulated drapery, indicating the influence of Classical Antiquity - that is, Greek sculpture. This classical influence heralds the decline of the (Roman-based) Romanesque style and the advent of (Greek influenced) Gothic art."

A sharp observer of urban life, George Bellows has sketched his streetwise subjects with characteristic vigor and economy of means, and he has carefully rendered their varied ethnic backgrounds. In turn-of-the-century slang, \"kids\" referred to roaming young hooligans, who were frequently the offspring of working-class immigrants living in Lower East Side tenements.\n\nIn 1908, when it was first exhibited, the painting garnered praise and derision alike. What one critic called \u201cone of the most original and vivacious canvases\u201d in the National Academy of Design exhibition was condemned by others for its \u201cinexcusable errors in drawing and general proportions\u201d and as \u201ca tour de force of absurdity.\u201d Soon afterward, a jury denied the work the prestigious Lippincott Prize at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts\u2019s annual exhibition, fearful that the prize donor might be offended by the title and subject of the painting. When asked if this was the case, Bellows quipped somewhat opaquely: \u201cNo, it was the naked painting that they feared.\u201d Its controversial reception notwithstanding, in 1909, Robert C. Hall purchased Forty-two Kids, marking the second sale of Bellows's career and his first to a private collector."

        "description": "This painting dates from the autumn of 1928, which Wood spent in Cornwall. In the extreme foreground, set against a backdrop of St Ives harbour, a fisherman bids farewell to a woman and a child, his sun-tanned face partially obscured as he leans to kiss the child\u2019s head. Their head-and-shoulder portraits seem superimposed on the detailed view of cottages, harbour, beach and pier. As the rectangular support is oriented horizontally, the background, alive with activity as the fishermen prepare to leave, suggests a tableau. While one group of men hauls a boat towards the sea, others are already crowded into a tiny vessel and heading towards the cluster of larger boats that await their crews on the far right of the composition. These preparations add to the poignancy of this scene of departure and deepen its atmosphere of impending loss. \n\nThe figures in the foreground are understood to be portraits of the artists Ben (1894\u20131982) and Winifred Nicholson (1893\u20131981), and their young son, Jake (b.1927). Wood became friends with the Nicholsons in 1926, exhibiting with Ben Nicholson at the Beaux Arts Gallery, London, in 1927. In the spring of 1928 he stayed with them at Bankshead, their cottage in the Lake District, and the three artists painted together, often out of doors. In August that year Wood joined the Nicholsons at Feock in Cornwall. \n\nIt was during this visit that Wood and Ben Nicholson, on a trip into St Ives, first met Alfred Wallis (1855\u20131942), a retired local fisherman who also painted. The art of the untrained Cornish artist, who worked on oddly shaped pieces of wood and cardboard, represented the ideals of a \u2018primitive\u2019 style that the younger artists admired (exemplified in Wallis\u2019s St Ives c.1928, Tate T00881). Wallis\u2019s work may have chimed with Wood\u2019s ideas on modernism, which valued what he saw as a deliberately na\u00efve approach to subject matter, as he expressed in a letter to his mother written in 1922, in which he described the \u2018great modern artists\u2019 as \u2018not trying to see things and paint them through the eyes and experience of a man of forty or fifty or whatever they may be, but rather through the eyes of the smallest child who sees nothing except those things which would strike him as being the most important\u2019 (quoted in Button, p.37). Wood and the Nicholsons stayed on in St Ives and from mid-September until December 1928, Wood rented a cottage near to Wallis\u2019s with views of Porthmeor Beach. This was one of the most intensely creative periods of his career. \n\nWood painted The Fisherman\u2019s Farewell during this time and it is possible that the painting refers to the actual departure of Ben Nicholson from St Ives in October 1928 (Richard Ingleby, Christopher Wood: An English Painter, London 1995, p.197). His portrayal of Nicholson as a fisherman in this painting is a sign of esteem for his friend, linking as it does the other artist to the traditional way of life that Cornwall suggested to them. In December, shortly before leaving Cornwall for London and then Paris, Wood wrote to Winifred Nicholson: \u2018I seem to live on the edge of the world. But what a world it is, I love this place and could stay here for ever if I had those around me for whom I care ... It will be hard to leave it.\u2019  \n\nWood died in tragic circumstances less than two years later. Suffering the effects of opium withdrawal, on 21 August 1930 he threw himself under a train."

The goddess assumes the classic contrapposto stance of Venus Anadyomene, accentuating the curves of her body while adjusting her hair. The painting's cool pastel hues create an atmosphere that evokes the dewy world of the sea.\n\nBouguereau drew inspiration from Renaissance masterworks like Raphael's The Triumph of Galatea and Botticelli's Birth of Venus, which he studied during his Prix de Rome scholarship in Italy. Unlike Raphael and Botticelli's nudes, Bouguereau's Venus displays a refined naturalism that reflects the new artistic tastes of the 1870s while retaining a Neoclassical artifice. The painting satisfies the challenge set by T.J. Clark for late-19th-century Salon painters to depict the flesh of modern women in Naturalist style while adhering to the Academic ideal of \"the body as a sign, formal and generalized, meant for a token of composure and fulfillment.\" Although Bouguereau's Venus is technically perfect and realistic, she lacks individual identity and remains confined to the role of an ideal.\n\nBouguereau's Venus received much acclaim and proved to be a commercial success. The painting's strong eroticism hints at Bouguereau's pragmatic methods of appealing to buyers. Unlike Botticelli's Venus, who hides her bosom seductively, Bouguereau's Venus invites the viewer to examine every part of her, unashamed of her nakedness and sensuality."

They were contemporaries (De Hooch lived from 1629 to 1684, Vermeer from 1632 to 1675), started their career in the same town (Delft) and both specialized in depicting domestic scenes situated in Dutch interiors. \r\nBut while Vermeer\u2019s genre pieces are characterized by a very sensitive, almost mysterious atmosphere, De Hooch presents us the clarity of the perfect household. This is how people in the Dutch Republic liked to see themselves: respectable citizens, living in clean houses that are distinguished, but surely not sumptuous. Everything and everybody in Dutch society had their own, proper place and the domestic interior was a reflection of that, Calvinist-inspired, vision.\r\nThis wonderful example, dating from 1663, of De Hooch\u2019s genre pieces also shows his concentration on architectural elements. He used them, together with the tiles, furniture, windows and the postures of the women, to structure the painting and organize its perspective space.\r\nDe Hooch\u2019s most effective \u2018trick\u2019 to create depth was the typical vista that allows us to catch a glimpse of the house in Dutch Renaissance style, on the other side of the canal in the background. The French writer Marcel Proust, in his famous book In Search of Lost Time, used this extraordinary device to describe the sensation of one of his characters: \u2018as in these interiors by Pieter de Hooch which are deepened by the narrow frame of a half-opened door, in the far distance, of a different color, velvety with the radiance of some intervening light."

        "description": "This altarpiece by Titian, one of the most inspirational works of Christian art, is undoubtedly among the greatest Renaissance paintings of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/venetian-school]Venetian School[/url]. The most substantial work of its type in Venice (nearly seven meters high), it was Titian's first major commissioned work in the city and took him two years to paint. It hangs over the high altar in the Franciscan Basilica of S. Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in  Venice, where its color and colossal size ensures that it can be seen from the other end of the church. \n\nWhen it was unveiled in May 1518, it instantly established the young artist as the pre-eminent figure of Venetian art. And it wasn't just its colossal size; it was a revolutionary composition. While earlier religious paintings inside churches (like Giorgione's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione/madonna-and-child-with-saints-liberale-and-francis-the-castelfranco-madonna-1505][i]The Castelfranco Madonna[/i][/url], 1505) had been relatively static, with statue-like saints and regal Madonnas, Titian's figures are bursting with energy and life, thus giving the work enormous emotional power and drama. Its effect on the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]High Renaissance[/url] painting was immediate. When first unveiled, Titian's [i]cinquecento[/i] contemporaries were immediately struck by the upward-striving dynamics, the dramatic expressiveness of the scene, and the agitation of the figures. It is perhaps no coincidence that, within 12 months, the mid-air quality and upward motion of the painting were emulated by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-transfiguration-1520][i]Transfiguration[/i][/url] (c.1518-1520). \n\nTitian divided this exquisite work of Biblical art into three sections. The lowest register represents the terrestrial plane where the disciples witness the assumption; in the middle section, the Virgin Mary soars upward, surrounded by a swarm of angelic cherubim, towards the top part representing Heaven, where God awaits her. The star of the painting is, of course, the Madonna, who is shown as being elevated upwards in a whirl of drapery on solid-looking clouds. Illustrating an essential event in Roman Catholicism - the moment when Mary is assumed into Heaven - it is the most famous Assumption in Renaissance art, if not all Western art. One gets the feeling that she is not just a symbol of salvation but perhaps a symbol of Venice, too. Above the Virgin, the heavenly zone is suffused with golden light (allegedly in homage to the tradition of Venetian mosaic art). At the same time, below her set in shadowy earth, the apostles (Saint Peter, Saint Thomas, and Saint Andrew) are stunned by the miraculous happening but also distraught at losing the mother of Christ, their savior. They implore her to stay, but her gaze is already directed towards Heaven. There, she is awaited by God,  who looks with a stern yet sad face on his children below.\n\nNowadays, Titian is most famous for his vibrant, sensual use of color and his radical technique of painting. Brush loads of color pigments appear to float across the canvas. His virtuoso handling of color is evident in the [i]Assumption[/i]: see how the two disciples in the red form a pyramid with the Madonna, drawing our eyes up to the red robe of God. Not long after finishing the [i]Assumption[/i], Titian painted a second large altarpiece in the Frari, known as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/pesaros-madonna-1526][i]The Madonna of the Pesaro Family[/i][/url] (1519-1526), that is an even better showcase of his exquisite rendering of the luxurious silks and velvets for which Venice was famous. And by moving the image of the Virgin and Child off-center, it again demonstrated the young artist's restless innovation. \n\nIn the [i]Assumption[/i], Titian used light and shadow to present the apostles as a mass of bodies rather than highlighting their individuality. This demonstrates the artist's awareness of developments in High Renaissance painting in Florence and Rome and his incorporation of these new ideas into his work. Titian also broke with tradition by omitting all details of the landscape in which the image is situated to focus on the events and emotions of the piece, although the sky above the apostles' heads suggests the setting is outside. The [i]Assumption[/i] takes added inspiration from several sources outside Venice. Compositionally, it shares certain iconographical features with the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-sistine-madonna-1513][i]Sistine Madonna[/i][/url] (1513) and other works of Raphael, while the vigorous figures of the disciples echo those in Michelangelo's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/sistine-chapel-ceiling-god-dividing-land-and-water-1512]Genesis fresco in the Sistine Chapel[/url]. In any event, the painting seems to indicate a clear desire on Titian's part to escape the confines of Venetian painting in order to establish his own universal style of religious art: a style which incorporates power and drama as well as the traditional Venetian appreciation of decorative art and clearly alludes to the coming of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/mannerism-late-renaissance]Mannerism[/url]. The brilliant Venetian neoclassical sculptor [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/antonio-canova]Antonio Canova[/url] described this work as the most beautiful painting in the world. In 1818, it was removed from the altar and transferred to the Venice Academy of Fine Art, where it remained for a century before being returned to the Frari in 1919."

        "description": "White Bread is one of Rosenquist's best-known works from this period, but it is not typical. The scale is relatively modest compared to other works he created at the time, and the composition is not interrupted by the sharp divisions and overlaid images that usually emerged from his collage process. Instead, the divisions and overlaps are elegantly found in the subject itself - four slices of store-bought white bread, the topmost of which is receiving a coat of the world's yellowest butter (or, more likely, margarine), courtesy of a very ordinary stainless steel knife.\r\n\r\nWhile commonly associated with pop art, Rosenquist never fit comfortably into the pop category, as this painting demonstrates. On the one hand, he generally eschewed brand names and logos, preferring more generalized commercial images. On the other, he dared to approach commercial illustration techniques even more closely than his pop cohorts, as can be seen in his efficient but careful rendering of the grooves in the knife and the gloss on the butter. At the same time, this work can be considered largely as an abstraction: the canvas is divided into simple shapes, and the use of the same yellow for both the spread and the background flattens the space, calling attention to the patterns formed by the bread crusts. In this regard, White Bread is similar to the radical simplicity, purity of shape, and sharp contours found in Ellsworth Kelly's color field paintings. Indeed, some commentators have detected Kelly's initials in the crusts. The possible influence of Roy Lichtenstein can also be seen in this work. In 1963, Lichtenstein painted Mustard on White, which shows a woman's hand delivering a bright yellow coating of mustard to a slice of white bread with a knife.\r\n\r\nIn sum, White Bread is a painting about culture and consumption made at a high point of American consumerism, but it is also a painting about painting, about the application of color to a support and its stunning visual results."

        "description": "[i]The Souls of the Mountains[/i] is one of the few artworks of Remedios Varo painted outside of Mexico. It was made in Paris, during Varo\u2019s first years of stay in the city, in a newly discovered world, occupied by Nazis. The essence of the painting allows us to catch a glimpse of the interwar French bourgeoisie\u2019 views of the woman and, more specifically, of the woman as an artist. The encased female characters in the artwork appear to be trapped inside the confining crust of the world, with only mist and darkness around them, in an unawakened state. Depicting the characters in such a manner, Varo evokes her inner feeling of isolation and shows the struggle of being a woman in that day and era.\n\nThe mountains can be viewed as phallic symbols, or as  a very thick, rock-hard mask the artist has to keep on to be accepted in the male-dominated art world she was then a part of. Female artists of this era were disregarded by the male artists, and were scaresly viewed as equals or as a real artists, hustled in the shadow of their painter spouses or partners. The cold-toned, gloomy palette of the painting was chosen to depict feelings of isolation and a hibernating state of the characters that want to escape their confinement. Dark and neutral misty strokes portray indecisiveness and uncertainty, but also Varo\u2019s hazy vision of her future and surroundings. To create this tableau, Varo applied a frequently used surrealist technique of fumage, smoking the oil painted canvas to build up tension inside the gloomy atmosphere of the painting. This particular technique was used to limit the artist\u2019s control over the painting, making room for the unconscious mind to guide the smoke of a candle flame into the desired shape and shade. The smoke, imprinted in the canvas, was then feathered away to make smooth patterns of clouds and mist, which in turn balance out the rocky, dominant shape of the mountains.\nThe title of the painting induces the idea that there is a life force under oppression which denies its freedom and right to be acknowledged; the souls should be freed of their confinement in order to be able to express themselves fully and without any restrictions from their surroundings, which in the artist\u2019s case come from the patriarchal society."

The stone was removed through trepidation, or drilling a whole into an individual\u2019s skull and literally removing the \u201cstone.\u201d Bosch\u2019s play on the imagery in the painting is beyond literal. The person performing the procedure is wearing a funnel hat, which at the time meant he was a charlatan, and the woman wears a book on her head, which also suggests folly. Combined, the images are a satire on madness and folly, as they depict a ridiculous scene, filled with symbolism of the nonsensical. "

The painting illustrates Tiffany's great interest in color and light, and shows a scene of intrigue\u2014a snake charmer playing to a gathered crowd in North Africa.

It is considered an icon of Scottish culture, painted during one of the most remarkable periods in the country's history, the Scottish Enlightenment.\r\nThe clergyman portrayed in this painting is the Reverend Robert Walker. He was a Church of Scotland minister who was born on 30 April 1755 in Monkton, Ayrshire. As a child, Walker's father had been minister of the Scots Kirk in Rotterdam, thus the young Robert almost certainly learnt to skate on the frozen canals of the Netherlands. He was minister of the Canongate Kirk as well as being a member of the Edinburgh Skating Club, the first figure skating club formed anywhere in the world. The club met on Duddingston Loch as shown in the painting, or on Lochend loch to its northeast between Edinburgh and Leith, when these lochs were suitably frozen.\r\nIn March 2005, a curator from the Scottish National Portrait Gallery suggested that the painting was by the French artist Henri-Pierre Danloux, rather than Sir Henry Raeburn. Once this information had been brought to the attention of the Gallery, the label on the painting was altered to read \"Recent research has suggested that the picture was actually painted....by Adrian Bordeaux.\" Since this time, many people have debated the idea of this. It has been argued that Danloux was in Edinburgh during the 1790s, which happens to be the time period when The Skating Minister was created. Supposedly the canvas and scale of the painting appears to be that of a French painter, although Raeburn critics argue otherwise.\r\nDespite continuing controversy about its attribution, The Skating Minister was sent to New York City in 2005 to be exhibited in Christie's for Tartan Day, an important Scottish celebration. James Holloway, director of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, told The Scotsman newspaper that \"my gut reaction is that it is by Raeburn.\" The newspaper reported that \"it is understood that Sir Timothy Clifford, director-general of the National Galleries of Scotland, now accepts the painting is a Raeburn.\""

        "description": "The Resurrection is a recurring theme in the art of Stanley Spencer. His most famous depiction of the subject is the enormous canvas (274.3 cm \u00d7 548.6 cm) [i]The Resurrection, Cookham[/i] (1924-1927), that was exhibited in 1927 as part of Spencer\u2019s first one-man show at the [i]Groupil Gallery[/i] in London. Years earlier, while staying with fellow painter Henry Lamb in Pool in 1922-1923, he created a detailed drawing of the composition and subsequently worked on the painting in Lamb\u2019s studio in London. The painting received great acclaim and [i]The Times[/i] stated it was \u201cthe most important picture painted by any English artist in the present century\u201d. It was immediately purchased by Lord Duveen for Tate\u2019s permanent collection, where it remains today.\n\nThe setting of [i]The Resurrection, Cookham[/i] is the Cookham churchyard with the river Thames in the background. Spencer spent most of his life in Cookham and developed a special connection to the village, which he referred to as \u2018a suburb of heaven\u2019. In his religious paintings, Spencer combined the heavenly and the earthly. In [i]The Resurrection, Cookham[/i], mundane people are rising from their graves, they are not reborn as celestial creatures but are entering an earthly version of heaven \u2013 the village of Cookham.\n[i]The Resurrection, Cookham[/i] depicts biblical figures alongside the artist\u2019s friends, neighbors, and family. God the Father and Christ are overseeing the event on the Church porch, and near them are prophets and thinkers like Moses. The dead are seen struggling to emerge from the graves and are led to the corners of their tombs. Spencer explored this motif in an earlier pair of paintings [i]The Resurrection of the Good and Bad[/i] (1913): \u201c\u2026when I did the first biggish paintings of \u201cThe Resurrection\u201d, in 1913, the punishment of the Bad was to be no more than that coming out of the graves was not so easy as in the case of the Good.\u201d\n\nIn [i]The Resurrection, Cookham[/i], the scene is populated by both black and white figures, to give the work a more universal quality. The black figures, however, were not based on individuals, and they served a symbolic purpose for the artist. Across the composition, people are engaged in a variety of activities: peacefully lying on the graves, reading the tombstones, and dusting each other off from the dirt. These small intimate acts were significant for Spencer: the act of dusting each other\u2019s clothes reminded the artist of his mother preparing his father for a trip to London. Similarly, the figures help spruce each other up, wanting to look their best when entering paradise. Spencer also included himself in the scene, he is seen beneath the porch, naked looking over to the side while reclining on a tombstone. His first wife Hilda appears in the painting three times: in the overgrown grave in the foreground, smelling a flower on the left, and in the distance, she is climbing steps that lead to the river. For Spencer, [i]The Resurrection: Cookham[/i] depicted a blissful awakening, that symbolized joy, optimism, and love."

        "description": "[i]Beata Beatrix[/i] (ca. 1864-1870) depicts a scene from the poem [i]La Vita Nouva[/i] (New Life) by Italian poet Dante Alighieri. Rossetti\u2019s fascination with Dante began in the mid-1840s. A few years later, Rossetti translated [i]La Vita Nouva[/i], which appeared in 1864 as part of his publication [i]The Early Italian Poets[/i]. Before painting [i]Beata Beatrix[/i], Rossetti already created numerous illustrations inspired by Dante\u2019s poem, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/the-meeting-of-dante-and-beatrice-in-paradise-1854][i]The Meeting of Dante and Beatrice in Paradise[/i][/url] (c.1854) and Dante`s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/dante-s-vision-of-rachel-and-leah-1855][i]Vision of Rachel and Leah[/i][/url] (c.1855).\n\nIn [i]Beata Beatrix[/i], the artist created a parallel between the Italian poet Dante\u2019s sorrow at the death of his beloved Beatrice, and his own biography, the death of his wife Elizabeth Siddal in 1862. Siddal died of an overdose of laudanum, and her death was most likely a suicide. Rossetti painted Siddal as Beatrice: he depicted her not in the moment of death, but in a state that he described as a \u201c[i]sudden spiritual transfiguration[/i].\u201d The portrait of Beatrice has a mystical and transcendental quality: she is pale and ghostly, but also sensual and ethereal. The red dove acts like a messenger, bringing her a poppy flower, an instrument of death. Unlike the white dove, a symbol of purity, the red dove can be interpreted as a symbol of passion. The poppy holds several meanings: it is a symbol of passion, but also sleep and death. The flower is also a reference to Siddal\u2019s overdose from laudanum, a drug that contains opium, which is made from the poppy flower.\n\nThe backdrop represents the city of Florence, the setting of Dante\u2019s story, and the bridge refers to Ponte Vecchio, a landmark of the city. In one of his letters, Rossetti discussed the role of the city in the painting: \u201c[i]You will remember how much Dante dwells on the desolation of the city in connection with the incident of her death, and for his reason, I have introduced it, as my background, and made the figure of Dante and love passing through the street and gazing ominously on one another, conscious of the event[/i]\u201d. The figure of Love is portrayed as an angel holding in her hand a flickering flame signifying Beatrice\u2019s life. The frame designed by Rossetti also references the city of Florence. He includes the date of Beatrice\u2019s death and a phrase from [i]Lamentations 1:1[/i] that Dante quotes in [i]La Vita Nuova[/i]: \u2018[i]Quomodo sedet sola civitas[/i]\u2019 which means  \u2018how lonely the city stands\u2019, referring to the mourning of Beatrice throughout Florence.\n\nGenerally, [i]Beata Beatrix[/i] is understood as a commemorative painting, the artist\u2019s expression of grief, and a tribute to his late wife. Rossetti worked on the oil painting for several years after Siddal\u2019s death, but he had created other renditions of the artwork before Siddal\u2019s death. Throughout his career, Rossetti often created several versions or replicas of his paintings. [i]Beata Beatrix[/i] was the first oil version of the image, and in 1889, it became a part of the Tate Britain collection. Although reluctant at first, Rossetti painted a second oil version for his patron William Graham, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/beata-beatrix-1872][i]Beata Beatrix[/i][/url] (c.1872), which is now part of the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. For this version, Rossetti added a predella \u2013 a painted panel at the bottom of the frame, which depicts the reunion of Beatrice and Dante in paradise. The additional frame provides a happy ending to the medieval love story, and perhaps reflects Rossetti\u2019s new outlook on his grief."

        "description": "[i]Drowning Girl[/i] (1963) is one of the most famous paintings of American [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop[/url] artist Roy Lichtenstein. It was based on the cover of the 1962 comic book [i]Run for Love[/i] by DC Comics. Lichtenstein significantly altered the original illustration, which shows the girl drowning in the foreground with her boyfriend in the background clinging to an overturned boat. The narrative text in the illustration presents a melodramatic love story: the girl is drowning because of a leg cramp, but she is so grief-stricken that she decides to drown instead of calling out to her boyfriend for help.\n\nLichtenstein cropped the image to show only the drowning girl surrounded by a threatening wave. By focusing on the girl\u2019s anguished expression, he heightened the dramatic quality of the image. The artist also altered the text in the thought bubble in two ways: changing the line \u2018I don\u2019t care if I have a cramp!\u201d to \u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d and changing the boyfriend's name from Mal to Brad. Lichtenstein found the name Brad more \u2018heroic\u2019, reassuring the viewer that the girl will ultimately be saved. Despite these changes, Lichtenstein still preserves the essential narrative of the love comics: a handsome boy and beautiful girl fall in love and a complication arises that threatens their relationship. The heroine is briefly heart-broken and distraught but ultimately gets her happy ending. Lichtenstein captures this sentiment of anguish by focusing on the girl and her emotional reaction. By playing up the melodramatic qualities of the story and the exaggerated behavior of the heroine, Lichtenstein injected irony and humor into the painting.\n\nIn terms of style, Lichtenstein mimicked the mass-produced image, by accentuating the thick black outlines and the contrasting colors. He painted the ink dots of the Ben-Day printing process used in the production of inexpensive comic books and magazines. Like in the mechanically produced illustration, the dots in the painting give the illusion of shading, which is visible in the red spots on the girl\u2019s skin and lips, and the grayish tones of the water. In this way, the painting conflates between the mechanical printing process and the traditional technique of oil painting, and between the mass-produced image in the comic book and the unique artwork.\n\nLike [i]Drowning girl[/i], many of Lichtenstein\u2019s early paintings were based on imagery found in cartoons and comic books. He found the style of comic books and cartoons appealing because it allowed him to depict emotionally charged, dramatic subject matters, like love and war, in a detached and calculated manner. Lichtenstein\u2019s art created a dialogue between fine art and popular imagery. In the case of [i]Drowning girl[/i], he stated that the woodblock print, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai/the-great-wave-of-kanagawa-1831][i]The Great Wave off Kanagawa[/i][/url] (1831) by the Japanese artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai]Hokusai[/url] was one of the inspirations for the stylized waves. Hokusai\u2019s prints were a form of the popular art of its era in Japan. Their status in the West was elevated in part because of the influence of Japanese prints on [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionist[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] painters. Through this reference, Lichtenstein reveals how easy it is to bridge between \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 art. Paintings like [i]Drowning girl[/i] continue this fusion by merging mainstream popular culture (cartoons and comic books) with high art."

        "description": "\u2022 i. De Mercurio \n\u2022 ii. The Lord of Illusion\n\nThis card is referred to the letter Beth, which means a house, and is attributed to the planet Mercury. The ideas connected with this symbol are so complex and so multifarious that it seems better to attach to this general description certain documents which bear upon different aspects of this card. The whole will then form an adequate basis for the full interpretation of the card through study, meditation, and use.\n\nThe French title of this card in the medieval pack is \u201cLe B\u00e2teleur\u201d, the Bearer of the B\u00e2ton. [Variant: LE PAGAD. Origin unknown. Suggestions:\n\n(1) PChD terror (esp. Panic fear) a title of Geburah. Also a thigh: i.e. membrum virile. By Arabic analogy, PAChD, causer of terror: Value 93!!\n\n(2) Pagoda, a phallic memorial: Similar, and equally apt.] Mercury is pre-eminently the bearer of the Wand: Energy sent forth. This card therefore represents the Wisdom, the Will, the Word, the Logos by whom the worlds were created. (See the Gospel according to St. John, chapter I.)\n\nIt represents the Will. In brief, he is the Son, the manifestation in act of the idea of the Father. He is the male correlative of the High Priestess. Let there be no confusion here on account of the fundamental doctrine of the Sun and Moon as the Second Harmonics to the Lingam and the Yoni; for, as will be seen in the citation from The Paris Working, (see Appendix) the creative Mercury is of the nature of the Sun. But Mercury is the Path leading from Kether to Binah, the Understanding; and thus He is the messenger of the gods, represents precisely that Lingam, the Word of creation whose speech is silence.\n\nMercury, however, represents action in all forms and phases. He is the fluidic basis of all transmission of activity; and, on the dynamic theory of the Universe, he is himself the substance thereof. He is, in the language of modern physics, that electric charge which is the first manifestation of the ring of ten indefinable ideas, as previously explained. He is thus continuous creation.\n\nLogically also, being the Word, he is the law of reason or of necessity or chance, which is the secret meaning of the Word, which is the essence of the Word, and the condition of its utterance. This being so, and especially because he is duality, he represents both truth and falsehood, wisdom and folly. Being the unexpected, he unsettles any established idea, and therefore appears tricky. He has no conscience, being creative. If he cannot attain his ends by fair means, he does it by foul. The legends of the youthful Mercury are therefore legends of cunning. He cannot be understood, because he is the Unconscious Will. His position on the Tree of Life shows the third Sephira, Binah, Understanding, as not yet formulated; still less the false Sephira, Da\u2019ath, knowledge.\n\nFrom the above it will appear that this card is the second emanation from the Crown, and therefore, in a sense, the adult form of the first emanation, the Fool, whose letter is Aleph, the Unity. These ideas are so subtle and so tenuous, on these exalted planes of thought, that definition is impossible. It is not even desirable, because it is the nature of these ideas to flow one into the other. One cannot do more than say that any given hieroglyph represents a slight insistence upon some particular form of a pantomorphous idea. In this card, the emphasis is upon the creative and dualistic character of the path of Beth.\n\nIn the traditional card the disguise is that of a Juggler.\n\nThis representation of the Juggler is one of the crudest and least satisfactory in the medieval pack. He is usually represented with a headdress shaped like the sign of infinity in mathematics (this is shown in detail in the card called the Two of Disks). He bears a wand with a knob at each end, which was probably connected with the dual polarity of electricity; but it is also the hollow wand of Prometheus that brings down fire from Heaven. On a table or altar, behind which he is standing, are the three other elemental weapons.\n\n\u201cWith the Wand createth He. \nWith the Cup preserveth He. \nWith the Dagger destroyeth He. \nWith the Coin redeemeth He.\u201d \nLiber Magi vv. 7-10.\u201d\n\nThe present card has been designed principally upon the Graeco-Egyptian tradition; for the understanding of this idea was certainly further advanced when these philosophies modified each other, than elsewhere at any time.\n\nThe Hindu conception of Mercury, Hanuman, the monkey god, is abominably degraded. None of the higher aspects of the symbol are found in his cult. The aim of his adepts seems principally to have been the production of a temporary incarnation of the god by sending the women of the tribe every year into the jungle. Nor do we find any legend of any depth or spirituality. Hanuman is certainly little more than the Ape of Thoth.\n\nThe principal characteristic of Tahuti or Thoth, the Egyptian Mercury, is, firstly, that he has the head of the ibis. The ibis is the symbol of concentration, because it was supposed that this bird stood continuously upon one leg, motionless. This is quite evidently a symbol of the meditative spirit. There may also have been some reference to the central mystery of the Aeon of Osiris, the secret guarded so carefully from the profane, that the intervention of the male was necessary to the production of children. In this form of Thoth, he is seen bearing the phoenix wand, symbolizing resurrection through the generative process. In his left hand is the Ankh, which represents a sandal-strap; that is to say, the means of progress through the worlds, which is the distinguishing mark of godhead. But, by its shape, this Ankh (crux ansata) is actually another form of the Rose and Cross, and this fact is perhaps not quite such an accident as modern Egyptologists, preoccupied with their attempted refutation of the Phallic school of Archaeology, would have us suppose.\n\nThe other form of Thoth represents him primarily as Wisdom and the Word. He bears in his right hand the Style, in his left the Papyrus. He is the messenger of the gods; he transmits their will by hieroglyphs intelligible to the initiate, and records their acts; but it was seen from very early times that the use of speech, or writing, meant the introduction of ambiguity at the best, and falsehood at the worst; they therefore represented Thoth as followed by an ape, the cynocephalus, whose business was to distort the Word of the god; to mock, to simulate and to deceive. In philosophical language one may say: Manifestation implies illusion. This doctrine is found in Hindu philosophy, where the aspect of Tahuti of which we are speaking is called Mayan. This doctrine is also found in the central and typical image of the Mahayana school of Buddhism (really identical with the doctrine of Shiva and Shakti). A vision of this image will be found in the document entitled \u201cThe Lord of Illusion\u201d .\n\nThe present card endeavours to represent all the above conceptions. Yet no true image is possible at all; for, firstly, all images are necessarily false as such; and, secondly, the motion being perpetual, and its rate that of the limit, c, the rate of Light, any stasis contradicts the idea of the card: this picture is, therefore, hardly more than mnemonic jottings. Many of the ideas expressed in the design are well expounded in the extracts from The Paris Working. \n\nI. DE MERCURIO \n[From The Paris Working.] \nHere follows a very full description of the nature of Mercury in several aspects, particularly his relation with Jupiter and the Sun:\n\n\u201cIn the Beginning was the Word, the Logos, who is Mercury; and is therefore to be identified with Christ. Both are messengers; their birth mysteries are similar; the pranks of their childhood are similar. In the Vision of the Universal Mercury, Hermes is seen descending upon the sea, which refers to Mary. [The path of Beth on the Tree of Life shows him descending from Kether, the Crown, upon Binah, the Great Sea.]The Crucifixion represents the Caduceus; the two thieves, the two serpents; the cliff in the vision of the Universal Mercury is Golgotha; Maria is simply Maia with the solar R in her womb. The controversy about Christ between the Synoptics and John was really a contention between the priests of Bacchus, Sol, and Osiris; also, perhaps, of Adonis and Attis on the one hand, and those of Hermes on the other, at that period when initiates all over the world found it necessary, owing to the growth of the Roman Empire and the opening up of means of communication, to replace conflicting Polytheisms by a synthetic Faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo continue the identification, compare Christ\u2019s descent into hell with the function of Hermes as guide of the dead. Also Hermes leading up Eurydice, and Christ raising up Jairus\u2019 daughter. Christ is said to have risen on the third day, because it takes three days for the Planet Mercury to become visible after separating from the orb of the sun. (It may be noted here that Mercury and Venus are the planets between us and the sun, as if the Mother and the Son were mediators between us and the Father.)\n\nNote Christ as the Healer, and also his own expression: \u201cThe Son of Man cometh as a thief in the night.\u201d Also this scripture (Matthew xxiv, 24-7):\n\n\u201cFor as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.\u201d\n\nNote also Christ\u2019s relations with the money-changers, his frequent parables, and the fact that his first disciple was a publican, i.e., tax-collector.\n\nNote also Mercury as the deliverer of Prometheus.\n\nOne half of the Fish symbol is also common to Christ and Mercury; fish are sacred to Mercury (owing presumably to their quality of movement and cold-bloodedness). Many of Christ\u2019s disciples were fishermen, and he was always doing miracles in connection with fish.\n\nNote also Christ as the mediator:\n\n\u201cNo man cometh unto the Father but by me\u201d, and Mercury as Chokmah \u201cthrough whom alone we can approach Kether.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Caduceus contains a complete symbol of the Gnosis. The winged sun or phallus represents the joy of life on all planes from the lowest to the highest. The serpents (besides being Active and Passive, Horns and Osiris, and all their other well-known attributions) are those qualities of Eagle and Lion respectively, of which we know, but do not speak. It is the symbol which unites the Microcosm and the Macrocosm, the symbol of the Magical operation that accomplishes this. The Caduceus is Life itself, and is of universal application. It is the universal solvent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see it all now; the virile force of Mars is far beneath him. All the other gods are merely aspects of Jupiter formulated by Hermes. He is the first of the Aeons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sense of humour of this god is very strong. He is not sentimental about his principal function; he regards the Universe as an excellent practical joke; yet he recognizes that Jupiter is serious, and the Universe is serious, although he laughs at them for being serious. His sole business is to transmit the force from Jupiter, and is concerned with nothing else. The message is Life, but in Jupiter the life is latent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith regard to Reincarnation, the heliocentric theory is right. As we conquer the conditions of a planet, we incarnate upon the next planet inwards; until we return to the Father of All, when our experiences link together, become intelligible, and star speaks to star. Terra is the last planet where bodies are made of earth; in Venus they are fluid; on Mercury aerial; while in the Sun they are fashioned of pure fire.\u201d\n\n[\u201dIn the Suns we remember; in the Planets we forget.\u201d - Eliphaz Levi.]\n\n\u201cI now see the eightfold star of Mercury suddenly blazing out; it is composed of four fleurs-de-lys with rays like anthers, bulrushes in shape between them. The central core has the cypher of the Grand Master, but not the one you know. Upon the cross are the Dove, the Hawk, the Serpent and the Lion. Also, one symbol yet more secret. Now I behold fiery swords of light. All this is upon a Cosmic scale. All the distances are astronomical. When I say \u201cSword\u201d, I have a definite consciousness of a weapon many millions of miles in length\u201d.\n\nII. THE LORD OF ILLUSION \n[Extract from Liber CDXVIII The Vision and the Voice: 3rd Aethyr (Ed. Princ. p.144.)]\n\nIt is the figure of the Magus of the Taro; in his right arm the torch of the flames blazing upwards; in his left, the cup of poison, a cataract into Hell. And upon his head the evil talisman, blasphemy and blasphemy and blasphemy, in the form of a circle. That is the greatest blasphemy of all (i.e., that the circle should be thus profaned. This evil circle is of three concentric rings). On his feet hath he scythes and swords and sickles; daggers; knives; every sharp thing-a millionfold, and all in one. And before him is the Table that is a Table of wickedness, the forty-two-fold Table.\n\nThis Table is connected with the forty-two Assessors of the Dead, for they are the Accusers, whom the soul must baffle; and with the forty-two-fold name of God, for this is the Mystery of Iniquity, that there was ever a beginning at all. And this Magus casteth forth, by the might of his four weapons, veil after veil; a thousand shining colours, ripping and tearing the Aethyr; so that it is like jagged saws, or like broken teeth in the face of a young girl, or like disruption, or madness. There is a horrible grinding sound, maddening. This is the mill in which the Universal Substance, which is ether, was ground down into matter.\n\nA voice says:\n\n\u201cBehold the brilliance of the Lord, whose feet are set upon him that pardoneth transgression. Behold the six-fold Star that flameth in the Vault, the seal of the marriage of the great White King and his black slave.\u201d\n\nSo I looked into the Stone, and beheld the sixfold Star: the whole Aethyr is as tawny clouds, like the flame of a furnace. And there is a mighty host of Angels, blue and golden, that throng it, and they cry: Holy, Holy, Holy art thou, that art not shaken in the earthquakes, and in the thunders! The end of things is come upon us; the day of Be-with-us is at hand! For he hath created the Universe, and overthrown it, that he might take his pleasure thereupon.\n\nAnd now, in the midst of the Aethyr, I behold that god. He hath a thousand arms, and in each hand is a weapon of terrible strength. His face is more terrible than the storm, and from his eyes flash lightnings of intolerable brilliance. From his mouth run seas of blood. Upon his head is a crown of every deadly thing. Upon his forehead is the upright Tau, and on either side of it are signs of blasphemy. And about him clingeth a young girl, like unto the King\u2019s daughter that appeared in the ninth Aethyr. But she is become rosy by reason of his force, and her purity hath tinged his black with blue.\n\nThey are clasped in a furious embrace, so that she is torn asunder by the terror of the god; yet so tightly clingeth she about him, that he is strangled. She hath forced back his head, and his throat is livid with the pressure of her fingers. Their joint cry is an intolerable anguish; yet it is the cry of their rapture, so that every pain, and every curse, and every bereavement, and every death of everything in the whole universe, is but one little gust of wind in that tempest-scream of ecstasy. [This image is to be found painted (usually on silk, and repeated in varying forms, often representing the planets, about its central glory) upon the sacred Banners which adorn the shrines of Tibet].\n\nAnd an Angel speaks:\n\n\u201cBehold, this vision is utterly beyond thine understanding. Yet shalt thou endeavour to unite thyself with the dreadful marriage-bed.\u201d\n\nSo I am torn asunder, nerve from nerve and vein from vein, and more intimately--- cell from cell, molecule from molecule, and atom from atom, and at the same time all crushed together. (Write down that the tearing asunder is a crushing together.) All the double phenomena are only two ways of looking at a single phenomenon; and the single phenomenon is Peace. There is no sense in my words or in my thoughts. \u201cFaces half-formed arose.\u201d This is the meaning of that passage; they are attempts to interpret Chaos. But Chaos is Peace Cosmos is the War of the Rose and the Cross. That was a \u201chalf- formed face\u201d that I said then. All images are useless.\n\nYea, as in a looking-glass, so in thy mind, that is backed with the false metal of lying, is every symbol read averse. Lo! everything wherein thou hast trusted must confound thee, and that thou didst flee from was thy saviour. So therefore didst thou shriek in the Black Sabbath when thou didst kiss the hairy buttocks of the goat, when the gnarled god tore thee asunder, when the icy cataract of death swept thee away.\n\nShriek, therefore, shriek aloud; mingle the roar of the gored lion and the moan of the torn bull, and the cry of the man that is torn by the claws of the Eagle, and the scream of the Eagle that is strangled by the hands of the Man. Mingle all these in the death-shriek of the Sphinx, for the blind man hath profaned her mystery. Who is this, Oedipus, Tiresias, Erinyes? Who is this, that is blind and a seer, a fool above wisdom? Whom do the hounds of heaven follow, and the crocodiles of hell await? \n\nAleph, Vau, Yod, Ayin, Resh, Tau, is his name. [These are the Paths forming a Current 1-2-6-8-9-10 on the Tree of Life]. \nBeneath his feet is the Kingdom, and upon his head the Crown. He is spirit and matter; he is peace and power; in him is Chaos and Night and Pan; and upon BABALON his concubine, that hath made him drunk upon the blood of the saints that she hath gathered in her golden cup, hath he begotten the virgin that now he doth deflower. And this is that which is written: Malkuth shall be uplifted and set upon the throne of Binah. And this is the stone of the philosophers that is set as a seal upon the Tomb of Tetragrammaton, and the elixir of life that is distilled from the blood of the saints, and the red powder that is the grinding-up of the bones of Choronzon.\n\nTerrible and wonderful is the Mystery thereof, O thou Titan that hast climbed into the bed of Juno! Surely thou art bound unto, and broken upon, the wheel; yet hast thou uncovered the nakedness of the Holy One, and the Queen of Heaven is in travail of child, and his name shall be called Vir, and Vis, and Virus, and Virtus, and Viridis, in one name that is all these, and above all these. [Vi Veri Vniversum Vivus Vici, the motto of the Master Therion as an 8=3] \n \n* * *\n\nThe following excerpt from Liber Aleph, the Book of Wisdom or Folly, may also help to elucidate the meaning of this card.\n\n\u201cTahuti, or Thoth, confirmed the Word of Dionysus by continuing it; for He shewed how by the Mind it was possible to direct the Operations of the Will. By Criticism and by recorded Memory Man avoideth Error, and the Repetition of Error. But the true Word of Tahuti was A M O U N, whereby He made Men to understand their secret Nature, that is, their unity with their True Selves, or, as they then phrased it, with God. And he discovered unto them the Way of this Attainment, and its relation with the Formula of INRI. Also by his Mystery of Number he made plain the Path for His Successor to declare the Nature of the whole Universe in its Form and in its Structure, as it were an Analysis thereof, doing for Matter what the Buddha was decreed to do for Mind.\u201d"

It is believed to have been painted prior to his trip to Europe and depicts the artist turning towards the viewer, his left hand positioned at his forehead, as if aiding his vision or shielding himself from bright light. In his right hand, he holds an artist's palette and mahlstick. This unique portrayal of the artist with the tools of his profession sets it apart as the only self-portrait of Reynolds in this style. The painting serves as evidence of his pride in his career and his skill as a self-promoter from a young age.\n\nIn contrast to typical portraiture of the time, where sitters were depicted formally and in established poses, Reynolds chose to depict himself as a man of action caught in the moment of painting. Art historian Mark Hallett notes that this departure from convention demonstrates Reynolds' experimentation with movement and non-traditional poses, which would go on to influence his later portraits. Originally a vertical composition, the painting was later reduced at the top and bottom, likely in the 19th century."

From the 1880s Waterhouse exhibited at the Royal Academy and the New Gallery both complex compositions with many figures as well as single figures often taken from literature or Greek mythology. It is possible that Waterhouse's painting of 'A Mermaid' was inspired by Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem 'The Mermaid' (1830) which includes the lines:\nWho would be/\nA mermaid fair/\nSinging alone/\nCombing her hair.\n\nTennyson's poem goes on to describe the mermaid seeking and finding love among the mermen.\n\nOf the bold merry mermen under the sea/\nThey would sue me, and woo me, and flatter me/\nIn the purple twilights under the sea/\nBut the king of them all would carry me/\nWoo me, and win me, and marry me.\n\nHowever Waterhouse was also interested in the darker mythology of the mermaid as an enchantress. Mermaids traditionally were sirens who lured sailors to their death through their captivating song. They were also tragic figures as mermaids could not survive in the human world which they yearned for and men could not exist in their watery realm, so any relationship was doomed. In Waterhouse's painting no sailors are depicted so that despite being a 'siren' the mermaid is shown as an alluring rather lonely figure, albeit with a fish tail. The atmosphere evoked is one of gentle melancholy as the mermaid sits alone in an isolated inlet, dreamily combing out her long hair with her lips parted in song. Beside her is a shell filled with pearls, which some believed to be formed from the tears of dead sailors.\n\nWhen the work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1901 the Art Journal noted her 'wistful-sad look' and the review remarked that 'it tells of the human longings never to be satisfied \u2026 The chill of the sea lies ever on her heart; the endless murmur of the waters is a poor substitute for the sound of human voices; never can this beautiful creature, troubled with emotion, experience on the one hand unawakened repose, on the other the joys of womanhood'."

Andreas later moved his family to the farm, Wonderhoek, about 30 kilometers from the Mission Station, where he worked as a teacher and evangelist. Sekoto\u2019s formative years were therefore spent in a much regulated religious milieu - during his formal schooling at Botshabelo College, his well regimented days started and ended with prayers, and attending church on Sundays was customary.\r\n\r\n\u2018Prayer in Church\u2019 is a testament to Sekoto\u2019s love of observing people and portraying their expressions and moods in his sketches and paintings.

His understanding of the principles of composition, form and colour, and his masterly treatment of light and shadow in this side-lit interior scene speaks of a confidence found only with an artist who is in control of his medium and technique. Both the artist, and the director of the Gainsborough Galleries, must have rated this painting very highly when it was exhibited on his 1947 solo exhibition there, as it was the second most expensive painting in the catalogue at 35 Gns.\r\n\r\nSekoto\u2019s strict Christian upbringing did not result in a life devoted to the church or its beliefs, but rather in a philosophy which Manganyi describes as having turned his pursuit of art into a kind of personal worldly religion. Sekoto wrote: \"Art is a human virtue and I have given my whole self to it, for it promotes understanding among races rather than destroys it.\"\r\n\r\nProvenance:\r\nGainsborough Galleries, Catalogue of Exhibition of Paintings by Gerard Sekoto, Johannesburg, July 22 - August 4, 1947\r\n\r\nIllustrated:\r\nSotheby Parke Bernet SA, Auction Catalogue of The Selig Gordon Collection and other important South African Paintings, Watercolours and Sculpture, Johannesburg, 6 March 1979, p 55, Lot 99\r\n\r\nBibliography:\r\nLesley Spiro, Gerard Sekoto: Unsevered Ties, Johannesburg Art Gallery, 1989, pp 41 and 68\r\nN Chabani Manganyi, Gerard Sekoto: \u2018I am an African\u2019, Johannesburg, 2004, p 105"

        "description": "In The Swan (N\u00ba 1), a black and white yin/yang mirror image depicts two swans in flight, united by the touch of a wing and their meeting beaks. The painting embodies the ancient Chinese symbolism of complementary and seemingly contrary forces. However, the work also conveys a sense of antagonism that reflects the struggle inherent in union, particularly between humans. Af Klint's signature colors, blue and yellow, appear on the birds' beaks and flippers, highlighting the quest for balance between the sexes. In The Swan No. 2, the subsequent painting in the series, the swans are thrust together, and the color created between them is now red instead of green. The redness encircles the birds, and it drips like blood from the black, \"female\" bird's wing, suggesting that the experience of passion and reproductive force can negatively obliterate female energy.\n\nThe Swan series, which takes place in the context of Paintings for The Temple, portrays a struggle between the swans that reflects the conflict between the heavenly and the underworld, good and bad, and peace and war. Many other paintings in the series depict targets for combat practice, adding to the theme of struggle. Swans, with their renowned strength and protective tendencies, are universal symbols of transcendence and completion in the alchemical tradition.\n\nWhen Klint created these works, she had moved away from the more automatic painting techniques she had used in the past, towards a more researched, thoughtful, and constructed approach. Despite this shift, her connection to the spiritual world remained present, particularly through Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophical spiritual theories that had deeply interested Af Klint at the time. According to critic Mark Hudson, the works display a sophisticated visual intelligence and a timelessly enigmatic quality, making it hard to believe that they were created as long ago as 1915."

Although Thomson retains the basic shape of the pine in his oil sketch, he makes the foreground considerably brighter in the canvas. The water surface, which in the oil sketch is hastily laid in with a muddy grey and then a yellowish-grey against the far shore, is transformed into long slabs of pigment in mauves, blues, and yellows, laying down long, unbroken battens of paint one above the other. \n \nThis dramatic change is especially evident in the sky. In the sketch, Thomson provides only a rapid swirl of nondescript character, deliberately leaving the wood surface exposed in several places\u2014just as he does in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/sketch-for-the-west-wind-1916]sketch[/url] for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/the-west-wind-1917][i]The West Wind[/i][/url] (1917). In the canvas, however, and even more emphatically than for the lake surface, he dresses the sky in wide, horizontal ribbons of paint. With subtle modulations from the yellow-green sunset clouds at the horizon through to the bluish arc that appears at the top of the painting, Thomson creates a perfect backdrop to the pine and its immediate foreground.\n \nThe color of the wood of the small panels has changed since it was milled almost a hundred years ago. When it was new, it was much lighter, possibly even a bright yellowish-white tone if it was of birch. The slow oxidizing over the years has turned the wood into a rich, honey-colored element in the painting and given it a mellow patina.\n \nWhat is surprising is the immense variety in the colors Thomson summons up for [i]The Jack Pine[/i], an array not seen in the sketch: sumptuous hues, complementing and contrasting light and dark, near and far, minute and grand. Even the softening of the distant shoreline, compared with the harder treatment in [i]The West Wind[/i], takes [i]The Jack Pine[/i] into that vivid yet dusky and indeterminate hour of the day that clearly bewitched Thomson."

The painting is one of twelve silkscreen portraits on canvas of Prince created by Warhol in 1984. These paintings and four additional works on paper are collectively known as the Prince Series.[1] Each painting is unique and can be distinguished by colour.\n\nOrange Prince (1984) is considered an important late work referencing Warhol's portraits from the early 1960s, of movie stars and celebrity icons, such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and Jacqueline Kennedy. Art historian and Warhol expert Thomas E. Crow believes that Warhol's portrait of Prince shows much greater freedom of expression, as in the early portraits. This is especially evident when compared to Warhol's more 'factory-line' style of portraits from the 1970s onwards, which were mainly commissions.[2]\n\nThe Warhol portraits were not commissioned by Prince, but rather were made by Warhol for his private collection. Crow believes Warhol was fascinated by Prince, a young star not in Warhol's direct circle. He says that Warhol was drawn to Prince's edgy image, which acted as inspiration for the art work:\n\n\"(Warhol's) evident fascination with Prince, known for sexual frankness in his music and an androgynous style in his clothes, make-up, and hairstyle, echoed similar traits among those he famously gathered around himself in the Factory entourage of the 1960s.\"[2][3]"

The Skater marks the end of his five-year apprenticeship to West. Stuart's first effort at full-length portraiture, its originality brought the artist so much notice at the 1782 Royal Academy exhibition that he soon set up his own studio.\r\n\r\nThe unorthodox motif of skating -- indeed, any presentation of vigorous movement at all -- had absolutely no precedent in Britain's \"Grand Manner\" tradition of life-size society portraiture. The painter recalled that when William Grant, from Congalton near Edinburgh, arrived to have his picture painted, the Scottish sitter remarked that, \"on account of the excessive coldness of the weather . . . the day was better suited for skating than sitting for one's portrait.\" Thus artist and sitter went off to skate on the Serpentine River in Hyde Park. When he returned to West's studio with Grant, Stuart conceived the idea of portraying his subject on ice skates in a winter landscape, with the twin towers of Westminster Abbey far in the distance.\r\n\r\nIn this innovative design, Grant glides effortlessly forward with arms crossed over his chest in typical eighteenth-century skating form. Except for his folded arms, the figure's stance derives from an ancient Roman statue, the Apollo Belvedere, a cast of which stood in the corner of West's studio."

His companion, nestled just behind him, holds an open beer jug and a glass of beer almost to her lips.\n\nLike the Jolly Toper, Leyster depicts a moment of fun, and fills the picture with a lively energy. The facial expression on the young woman is particularly interesting: her cheeks flushed, she sends her half-smile towards her companion, looking at him fondly, or perhaps rather lasciviously. This could lead us to speculate on their relationship: are they a couple? Are they husband or wife? Or is another kind of transaction going on? Leyster leaves this unclear; she does however seem to suggest that this woman is sure of herself, and is not shy to show her own desire.\n\nThe man's direct look towards the viewer is open and relaxed, suggesting he hopes that the crowd enjoys his music as much as he does. Leyster often depicted musicians, either individually or in groups, creating her own interpretations on the theme of \"the merry company\" which often showed people of mixed genders drinking and having fun.\n\nThis painting was attributed to Frans Hals for hundreds of years due to a deliberate forgery. Leyster's signature was discovered in 1893."

        "description": "Stanley Spencer was born in the historic village of Cookham, which was one of the chief inspirations for his art. For Spencer, Cookham was \u201ca village in Heaven\u201d, and it was the setting of many of his religious paintings. One of these was the series [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stanley-spencer/all-works#!#filterName:Series_christ-preaching-at-cookam-regatta,resultType:masonry][i]Christ Preaching at Cookham Regatta[/i][/url] that Spencer began painting in 1952. The artist based the series on his memories of the Regatta in the Edwardian era (1901-1910).\n\nThe idea for the series traces back to a drawing Spencer made in the late 1920s. It portrayed Christ preaching from the horse ferry barge in the Thames surrounded by punt boats filled with elegant visitors heading to the regatta. Spencer was not satisfied with the drawing, and even though he briefly returned to the idea in 1938, these new studies were also not realized until 1949. He began painting the series by selecting several scenes from 68 red cont\u00e9 sketches of the regatta.\n\nThe series contains a large central painting (207 cm x 534 cm) [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stanley-spencer/christ-preaching-at-cookham-regatta-unfinished-1958][i]Christ Preaching at Cookham Regatta[/i][/url] (1959), and six smaller canvases of various formats and sizes. Only the central painting directly relates to the religious subject, while the accompanying paintings described the activities that occur on the river and the riverbank. Spencer died before he was able to complete the central work of the series, thus his vision of the series was never fully realized.\n\nOne of the accompanying painting, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stanley-spencer/christ-preaching-at-cookham-regatta-punts-on-the-river-1958][i]Christ Preaching at Cookham Regatta: Punts by the River[/i][/url] (1958), depicts a group of girls in summer dresses talking in the punting boat. Most of the accompanying paintings show Cookham\u2019s high society dressed in their finest garments, enjoying the festivities of the Regatta. Spencer remembered how the Regatta emphasized class distinction, between those who could afford a punt and those who could only watch from the sidelines. The local girls in [i]Punts by the River[/i] stand in contrast to the elegant village elite, they are dressed in simple clothes celebrating a rare break from their daily routine. The figures were probably based on local adolescents Spencer knew from the village. At the top of the composition, a nude young man seems to be trying to join the conversation, which adds an erotic element to the scene. His contorted pose is reminiscent of a saint in a Renaissance altarpiece, which brings a mystical component to the painting. The young man strongly resembles the artist, which is possibly a sign of Spencer\u2019s nostalgia for his adolescent days in Cookham.\n\nThe series was conceived for Spencer\u2019s ambitious project [i]Church-house[/i], a unique exhibition space that would house his Cookham paintings. The [i]Church-house[/i] was a half-secular half-religious building devoted to love and loss. The design of the building was meant to mirror the topography of Cookham, the High Street would be the nave and the two side aisles would represent the School Lane and the River. Spencer intended the [i]Christ Preaching at Cookham Regatta[/i] series for the River aisle. Even though Spencer worked intensely on [i]Church-house[/i] in his final years, he was not able to realize the project before his death in 1959."

He looks up and out of the frame, as if lost in concentration, or perhaps in the beautiful music itself. The precise placement of his fingers suggests a musician completely at ease with his instrument. At the same time, the composition of the painting is slightly unusual: against this plain interior, Leyster includes a violin and a recorder awkwardly displayed on the wall. The boy's posture is also slightly strange, as he leans back against what looks like a damaged chair. The boy's dreamy gaze suggests the power of music to transport the listener, a power not unlike the power of art.\n\nThere are many similarities between painting and music that run throughout Leyster's career. Art critic Peter Schjeldahl comments particularly on her virtuosic use of color here: \"The work's finely modulated browns and grays are breathtaking. They affect like essences of the flute's sound - you practically hear them.\""

Instead, in [i]The Dance[/i] Derain built upon [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Style_synthetism,resultType:masonry]Gauguin\u2019s Synthetic style[/url], which aimed to synthesize between the outward appearance of the subject, the artist\u2019s emotional response to the subject and the aesthetic considerations of line, form and color. Inspired by Gauguin, Derain painted large areas of bold flat colors and used non-local colors not to merely imitate nature, but also to express the emotional and spiritual qualities of things.\n\nThe emphasis on the decorative elements in [i]The Dance[/i] can be attributed to Gauguin, but these also relate to another source \u2013 French Romanesque sculpture. Derain\u2019s treatment of the drapery worn by the dancer on the left is most similar to the sculptures from the Burgundy area, in the cathedrals in Autun, Saulieu and Vezelay. Even though there is no evidence that Derain visited Burgundy, examples were available to Derain in photographs and in museum collections \u2013 specifically, Derain visited the National Museum of French Monuments that holds life size casts of the cathedrals in Burgundy. Derain also found inspiration in the Louvre, likely modeling the figure on the right after the servant figure in Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/the-women-of-algiers-in-their-apartment-1834-1][i]Women of Algiers[/i][/url] (1834).\n\nThe other major influence is non-Western art, a combination of sources of African and Asian art. In [i]The Dance[/i] these elements reflect Derain\u2019s interest in Gauguin and the influence of non-Western art on his work, as well as his own affinity for these artistic traditions. Derain had access to many of these artworks through the Guimet Museum in Paris, which holds one of the largest collections of Asian art outside of Asia. [i]The Dance[/i] is similar to Indonesian relief sculpture in terms of composition and the motif of dancing figures against a flat stylized landscape. In particular, the three central figures resemble a 10th century pediment from the Cambodian temple Banteay Srei at the Guimet Museum. In the context Derain\u2019s body of work, [i]The Dance[/i] concluded the artist\u2019s decorative [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Fauve style[/url], after which he painted in a more sculptural style inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]C\u00e9zanne[/url] and the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubist movement[/url].\n"

He wrote to her that \"I would not be without your portrait for the world. The sight of it soon calms my spirit under all trouble, and it is always the first thing I see in the morning and the last at night.\" The portrait was deemed an excellent likeness, with the fine and detailed finish of Maria's face contrasting with the looser brushstrokes comprising the background and her blouse.\n\nDespite painting over 100 portraits in his career, most were executed out of financial necessity rather than an inherent interest in the genre. Nevertheless, many are refreshingly candid in their depictions, and there is a palpable sense of character and personality in the images he created. Constable did not compromise unique features to conform to contemporary beauty standards. This particular portrait exhibits a special sensitivity and warmth, which can be attributed to his close relationship with the sitter.\n\nThis portrait shares similarities with many of his other works in terms of the use of similarly colored, neutral backgrounds, and the composition of the sitters. Constable's portrayal of faces was always painstakingly detailed, but his approach to the sitter's garments varied depending on his relationship with the subject. Some clothing was rendered meticulously, while others were suggested through much looser brushwork, as seen in this portrait. This variance can be attributed to the commission basis of his work, where paintings for patrons were expected to be more highly finished."

        "description": "[i]The Artist and His Mother[/i] (1926-1936) represents the pinnacle of Arshile Gorky\u2019s figurative paintings. It is based on a photograph of the painter and his mother, taken in 1912 in his native country Armenia. Only three years later, the Ottoman Empire began the systematic extermination of the Armenian people, known as the Armenian Genocide. Even though Gorky and his family survived a death march, the ordeal caused permanent damage. His mother\u2019s health particularly suffered, and in 1919, she died of malnourishment.\n\nGorky began working on the double portrait in 1926 and worked toward the final version over the next decade. During this period, Gorky made many [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-artists-s-mother]preparatory sketches[/url] and studies. For example, two quick pen sketches drawn side by side were used to set up the composition and arrangement of the painting. In another pencil sketch, the artist created a detailed study for the painting by using a grid with numbered squares to enlarge the drawing. He also created another version of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-artist-and-his-mother-1942][i]The Artist and His Mother[/i][/url] (ca.1926-1942) in a warmer color palette. Still, this version does not appear to be as sharp and precise in its painterly treatment and finishing touches.\n\nIn [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i], Gorky applied and scrapped thin layers to give the surface the soft glow of marble or porcelain. He painted stiff figures in cool and muted colors, blending patches of ochre, blue, green, and brown. The figure of the mother resembles a statue, due to the severe posture and the flat surface of the apron that looks like a smooth piece of marble or stone. In terms of style, [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i] was influenced by the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url], especially the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-gertrude-stein-1906][i]Portrait of Gertrude Stein[/i][/url] (1906). In this painting and other portraits, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/portrait-of-vartoosh-1937][i]Portrait of Vartoosh[/i][/url] (1936-1937), the artist paid particular attention to the eyes. For Gorky, expressive eyes were characteristic Armenian features. As a child, he might have seen in his native village medieval religious paintings and manuscripts that highlighted these features. Later, while visiting American museums, Gorky discovered Russian icons, and the large eyes in Sumerian and Hittite art, which he associated with his ancestry in the Caucuses.\n\nThe horrible events that shaped Gorky\u2019s early life and the traumatic loss of his mother come across in [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i]. When painting the scene, Gorky chose to leave parts unfinished. By erasing the two hands of his mother, he injected a sense of violence into the painting. The figures in Gorky\u2019s art, especially his mother, seem to disintegrate in the same way that memories become more elusive with time. Gorky transformed the old photograph into introspection on his mind: on the canvas, he reconstructed the complex emotional response to the photograph. The statue-like figure of the mother, the hollow eyes, and the numb expression make her seem almost ghost-like. In comparison, the figure of the young boy has three dimensions and a distinctly sad expression. For Gorky, the painting was an expression of personal loss, and for many others, it became a symbol of the tragedy of the Armenian Genocide."

In the V&A\u2019s painting The Garden of the Hesperides (1882) Burne-Jones has reduced the number of daughters to two, apparently in the interests of symmetry. It provides an example of his interest in classical form, especially in the treatment of the background and in the shapes of the ewer and harp. The scene is represented in low relief. Platinum, a white metal, was used in addition to the more common gold leaf in the gilding.\""

From modest origins, she worked young and carried out many activities before becoming familiar \u2013 she was then a model \u2013 with artists' studios, at a time when the space of women of her social condition was reduced to domestic interiors. His apprenticeship is made of sketches of everyday scenes, street workers, ordinary people, and his models are more often members of his entourage than professionals. The odalisque of The Blue Room takes up a pictorial clich\u00e9 to reformulate it. The woman lying on the bed is not naked, but dressed, not in the oriental style like Matisse's odalisques, but like a modern woman. His shirt with suspenders, his striped pajamas not only evoke eroticism or sexual expectation but also the rest of a body in the comfort of loose and colorful clothes, which affirm a desire for modernity. The detail of the cigarette, ostensibly stuck in the mouth, then characterizes women of little virtue, like the gigolettes of Kupka or the women artists. This modernity is attached here to the representation of a mature woman, with thick hands, a weary and heavy body, with heavy breasts. According to Valadon, \u201cyou have to have the courage to look the model in the face if you want to reach the soul. Never bring me to paint a woman who is looking for the lovable or the pretty, I will disappoint her right away. The composition, which takes up the traditional scheme of the voluptuous nude framed by curtains, takes us into the bohemian intimacy of the studio saturated with intense blues. Lost in thought, the woman forgets the painter's intrusion: it's a stolen moment.\n\n[url href=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/ressources/oeuvre/cpg8rdy]centrepompidou[/url]"

Most of the scenes, including the one featuring a man wrestling with a lion, are modelled on profane art from the Roman period or on Byzantine Art. It is likely that this scene was modelled on the popular motif of Hercules wrestling with the lion. That being said, the biblical hero Samson overcoming a lion was a popular and frequently depicted scene in the Middle Ages. If the man on the Shrine of the Magi is indeed Samson, this scene signifies Christ\u2019s victory over the devil or humankind\u2019s victory over evil."

        "description": "This work by Titian, one of the most famous Renaissance portraits, languished in the Farnese family cellars in Rome for more than a century before it was hung on a wall. Now it can be seen in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte in Naples, as is regarded by scholars as a perfect example of [i]cinquecento[/i] portrait art - a masterpiece of characterization, body language, and color. Commissioned by the Farnese family in 1546, like many papal portraits it was intended as a public statement of Farnese power. In the work, the 77-year old Pope Paul III is shown seated, accompanied by his Grandsons, the Cardinals Alessandro and Ottavio Farnese. Aside from the coloristic magic that Titian creates with his rich, warm color palette, the work perfectly complements the earlier group portrait by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] - [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portraits-of-leo-x-cardinal-luigi-de-rossi-and-giulio-de-medici-1518][i]Pope Leo X with Cardinals[/i][/url] (1518) - which is another masterful representation of Papal power and character. \n\nIn the 16th century, in order to avoid being steamrollered on political and religious issues by Spain or France, the head of the Catholic Church needed money, military resources and a cunning, resourceful mind. In this wonderful example of Venetian portrait painting, Titian represents his subject accordingly. It was well known that Pope Paul III applied few if any religious rules to his own conduct. To him, and to many of his predecessors, a religious career was merely an opportunity for self-enrichment. He had his own concubine, with whom he had fathered four children; he made both his grandsons Cardinals, and he amassed a huge personal fortune from church taxes and other benefits. With Emperor Charles V, King of Spain, angling for both financial support (against rebellious Protestants in the Low Countries) and reform of the Catholic Church, and the King of France at loggerheads with Charles, Pope Paul had to tread a devious path between the two monarchs. Titian thus presents him as a man whose body is turned one way, but whose head faces another. His face is shrunken, his beard is unkempt, yet he seems full of dynamic energy - almost as if he is ready to pounce. His eyes are bright and twinkling, but they possess a sort of peasant watchfulness. In short: a wealthy, slightly devious old man.\n\nAlessandro and Ottavio are the two eldest sons of Paul's son Pier Luigi. They symbolize the continuity of the Farnese Papal line. Raphael's Medici Family Pope, Leo X, had in time been succeeded by his nephew Cardinal Giulio de'Medici as Pope Clement VII, so Paul naturally wanted a successor of his own. Of course Cardinal Alessandro was no more religious than his grandfather. In fact, apart from several mistresses, he diverted huge sums from the Church into his collection of rare antiquities and Renaissance art at the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. X-rays of the canvas show that he was originally positioned further to the left. In all likelihood, he convinced Titian to move him closer to the Pope - even to the extent of grasping the top of Paul's chair with his right hand - as a sign of his claim to the Papacy. The ambivalent expression that Titian gives him is no more than he deserves. Not least because it was Alessandro who invited Titian to Rome with the promise of living for his son, in place of a fee. In the end, Titian's son was paid off with a small parish worth a fraction of the original offer - an insulting reward for his father's time and effort.\n\nPaul's younger son, the 21-year old Ottavio (married to a daughter of Charles V), is shown leaning towards the Pope, about to bow and kiss the papal foot as prescribed. The body language is unmistakable - here is a person who is not 'upright'! Moreover, his serious face alludes to a major dispute between himself and his grandfather over the Duchy of Parma, which initially had been promised to him, but was now going to a relative of the King of France.\n\nThe Pope's hand, strictly speaking, should be visible on the far side of the table. But for reasons that remain unclear, Titian did not paint it. Other areas of the painting were also left unfinished. After detailed study, the Italian art historian Roberto Zapperi has concluded that the most likely explanation was the shift in papal political allegiances (away from Spain, towards France) that took place as the picture was being completed. Being an expensive-looking large format work, as well as something of a political statement, the painting was deemed to be no longer appropriate in the new political climate and was therefore consigned to the darkness of the Farnese cellars. \n\nTitian was the first painter for whom color in painting was more important than any other aesthetic or painterly element. Not only are there very few examples of drawing by him, but also he uses color to establish the setting, create atmosphere, and represent all the varying reflections of his subjects situations and personalities. In his oil painting, visible brush strokes and strongly textured surfaces replace the \"smooth finish\" required by the traditions of the High Renaissance. (Michelangelo, for instance, criticized the lack of [i]disegno[/i] in Titian's work, and its subordination to [i]colorito[/i], but complimented the Venetian's coloring.) Titian became the acknowledged leader of Renaissance art in Venice, forming in the process a notoriously self-serving 'triumvirate', along with the sculptor/architect Jacopo Sansovino and the scurrilous writer Pietro Aretino, who became his publicity agent."

The images depicted on the shrine include scenes from the history of salvation from the dawning of time to the Last Judgment. Although the shrine was shortened by one axis after being hidden from French revolutionary troops in 1794, it was largely restored to its original shape during the most recent period of restoration, which lasted from 1961 to 1973. The intention in the Middle Ages was that the shrine would be placed in the crossing. Today, however, it rises above the medieval high altar at the back of the inner choir, making this area the main focus of the Gothic cathedral, which was built as a stone reliquary for this precious shrine."

        "description": "[i]Iscariot Blues[/i] (2006) is part of a series of blue paintings that the artist executed after his move to Trinidad in 2005. Ofili first visited Trinidad in 2000, as part of an artist residency. Soon after, the impact of the Caribbean environment became noticeable in his art. It was one of the inspirations for the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/all-works#!#filterName:Series_within-reach-2003,resultType:masonry]series of red, black, and green paintings[/url], which were exhibited at the 50th Venice Biennale in 2003.\n\nThe blue paintings signify a significant stylistic departure for Ofili, who is best known for applying different materials to his paintings, like paper cutouts, glitter, pins, and elephant dung. Instead, in [i]Iscariot Blues[/i], and other paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/blue-riders-2006][i]Blue Riders[/i][/url] (2006) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/blue-steps-fall-from-grace-2011][i]Blue Steps (Fall from Grace)[/i][/url] (2011), the artist focused on the flatness of the surface and a monochrome palette of blue, black and silver. This new approach is connected to his life in Trinidad, especially to the experience of nighttime. The artist explained how twilight and darkness in Trinidad ignite the imagination: the hilly landscape and dense vegetation give a sense that something is happening on the other side. Unlike night in a big city that is illuminated by artificial lights, in Trinidad, one must rely on the moonlight and the sensitivity of the eyes. In these paintings, Ofili aims to capture this mood, the night that is mysterious and even frightening. The blue paintings took their name from the early 20th-century [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/expressionism]Expressionist[/url] group [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/der-blaue-reiter-the-blue-rider]The Blue Rider[/url], established by Russian and German artists. The art historian Christopher Zuschlag pointed out that philosophical and artistic ideas associated with The Blue Rider artists like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc]Franz Marc[/url] appeal to Ofili: the idea of creating a synthesis between the arts, both in connecting it to music and in equally valuing European and non-European art, high art and folk art.\n\n[i]Iscariot Blues[/i] portrays two local musicians playing Parang, favorite folk music from Trinidad and Tobago, and the Bobolee figure - an Easter tradition in Trinidad where an effigy of Judas Iscariot is hung and beaten by villagers on Good Friday. The shapes of the musicians were inspired by plywood cutouts of musicians in Lopinot, a village in Trinidad. The artist was attracted to the flatness of the cutouts, and he took a few photographs from which he later painted the figures before adding the figure of Judas. Ofili chose to paint Judas Iscariot naked to reflect the feeling of shame and regret that led Judas to commit suicide after he betrayed Jesus Christ. The nudity exposes the figure, his shame, and remorse. By using a silver base, Ofili\u2019s figure of Judas glows, as if it is absorbing or reflecting the moonlight. The monochrome palette of blues is also linked to Trinidad folklore: the \u2018[i]jab jab[/i]\u2019 or \u2018blue devil\u2019 is a carnival beast that stalks the streets. In the context of the Carnival, blue symbolizes \u2018evil\u2019 and \u2018destruction.\u2019 The artist will later directly address the folklore of the \u2018blue devil\u2019 in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/blue-devils-2014][i]Blue Devils[/i][/url] (2014)."

        "description": "[i]Proserpine[/i] (1874) depicts the goddess as the Empress of the Underworld.  According to Greek and Roman mythology, Proserpine was the beautiful daughter of Ceres, the goddess of agriculture. She was abducted by the ruler of the Underworld, Pluto, who brought her to his realm to marry her. Ceres pleaded with Jupiter, the king of gods, for Proserpine's return, and Jupiter agreed under the condition that she had not consumed any of the fruits of the Underworld. However, Proserpine ate six grains of pomegranate, thus she was forced to accept her new role and destiny: her punishment was to spend six months of the year on earth, and six months in the Underworld. In Rossetti's painting, Proserpine is in a gloomy corridor of her palace; she seems pensive and sullen while holding a pomegranate, a symbol of her captivity. Next to her is an incense burner, the attribute of a goddess.\n\nRossetti, both a poet and a painter, often paired the two arts by creating accompanying poems for his paintings. For [i]Proserpine[/i], Rossetti wrote a sonnet and inscribed it in Italian on the picture and in English on the frame:\n\nAfar away the light that brings cold cheer\nUnto this wall, - one instant and no more\nAdmitted at my distant palace-door.\nAfar the flowers of Enna from this drear\nDire fruit, which, tasted once, must thrall me here.\nAfar those skies from this Tartarean grey\nThat chills me: and afar, how far away,\nThe nights that shall be from the days that were.\nAfar from mine own self I seem, and wing\nStrange ways in thought, and listen for a sign:\nAnd still some heart unto some soul doth pine,\n(Whose sounds mine inner sense in fain to bring,\nContinually together murmuring,) -\n\"Woe's me for thee, unhappy Proserpine!\"\n\nThe sonnet plays a complementary role, revealing to the viewer the symbolic meaning of the figure in the painting. Through the poem, Rossetti not only draws attention to the myth of Proserpine but also reveals to the viewer the inner thoughts behind her silent expression. \n\nThe model in the painting is Jane Morris, the wife of artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-morris]William Morris[/url]. Jane was one of Rossetti's favorite muses, who embodied the ideal of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood]Pre-Raphaelite[/url] beauty. She modeled for many of Rossetti's paintings, including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/the-day-dream-1880][i]The Day Dream[/i][/url] (1880) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/the-pia-of-tolomei-1880][i]Pia de' Tolomei[/i][/url] (c.1868). The two also had a romantic relationship, that spanned in various degrees over nearly two decades, until Rossetti died in 1882.\n\nRossetti painted [i]Proserpine[/i] while staying with the couple at Kelmscott. Many have drawn a connection between the myth of Proserpine and the personal life of Jane Morris. By all accounts, Jane was in an unhappy marriage, which was further complicated by her work and relationship with Rossetti.  The artist probably viewed Jane as Proserpine, another beauty trapped in a sad situation, unable to free herself from her destiny. \nRossetti often created replicas of his paintings, and Proserpine is one of the most famous examples. A total of eight oil versions were created, this was the seventh, and it was painted for Rossetti's patron, Frederick Leyland. The picture replaced an earlier version that was damaged in transit. Today, Proserpine is part of the collection of Tate Britain, London."

It is this phase which I have tried to depict in my painting. St. Anthony, alone in the desert, struggles against his visions; half-formed, moving in indolent suggestion, colored with the beautiful colors of sex, his desires take shape even in the folds of his own wind-tossed robes.\""

        "description": "The Return of the Herd is one of a cycle depicting the months, five paintings of which have survived. This picture presumably depicts November.\n\nMany of Bruegel's paintings show people not so much as the masters of nature but rather as a part of it: there is hardly any difference here between the coloration of the cattle and that of their drovers.\n\nNovember is the month in which the cattle return to their winter quarters from the summer pastures and Bruegel shows them being driven towards the hill-top village. In this panel Bruegel's remarkable technique can be studied at its best. Individual forms are built up with the greatest economy. Within the sketched outline the paint is laid on thinly, sometimes with an almost dry brush. The light brown gesso underpainting is allowed to show through, in this instance giving a warm brown tone to the whole foreground. Bruegel must have composed the Months largely on the panels themselves; only one preparatory drawing on paper survives, a study for one of the hunters in The Hunters in the Snow, the January panel. Having prepared the panel, Bruegel drew the outlines of the composition in paint with a thin brush and then added the thinly-scraped areas of colour within those outlines."

        "description": "[i]Gassed[/i] (1919) by John Singer Sargent depicts the aftermath of a mustard gas attack on the Western Front in August 1918. This is a unique painting in Sargent\u2019s body of work, who is best known for fashionable portraits, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/lady-agnew-of-lochnaw][i]Lady Agnew of Lochnaw[/i][/url] (1892) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/the-wyndham-sisters-1899][i]The Wyndham Sisters: Lady Elcho, Mrs. Adeane, and Mrs. Tennant[/i][/url] (1899). In May 1918, Sargent was commissioned by the British government to create a large painting for the Hall of Remembrance for World War I. As an American painter, Sargent was asked to create a painting that represented the idea of Anglo-American cooperation. In 1918, Sargent traveled to France with fellow artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henry-tonks]Henry Tonks[/url] to observe the troops on the Western Front, visiting the Guards Division at Bavincourt and the American Division at Ypres. Sargent struggled to find a suitable subject for the painting, he wanted to paint an epic showing masses of men, but could not find a scene that featured many British and American soldiers. Sargent considered several ideas before deciding to paint the aftermath of the mustard gas attack he witnessed while in France. He described the incident in a letter to biographer Evan Charteris as  [i]\u2018one harrowing sight, a field full of gassed and blindfolded men\u2019[/i]. \n\n[i]Gassed[/i], a painting of a heroic scale (231x611 cm) shows several lines of wounded soldiers moving toward the dressing station. The scene is dark and tragic: the soldiers blinded by the gas have their eyes bandaged, they hold onto each other as medical orderlies assist them. All around them are bodies of wounded and dead piled on top of one another. \n\nSargent exposes the reality of war and the horrific impact of chemical weapons, his heroes are helpless and broken men, whose fates are a mystery - will they recover or see again, will they even survive? There is also activity in the background, biplanes flying through the sky and a group of soldiers playing football. Sargent\u2019s painting examines the harsh realities of war: the poor conditions and equipment of the troops and the human suffering caused by the gas attack. The ongoing football match indicates how these horrors have become a constant presence that no longer interrupts the daily routine.\n\nSargent painting draws on the tradition of heroic paintings: the composition was inspired by the triptych [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-uccello/the-battle-of-san-romano-1440][i]The Battle of San Romano[/i][/url] (ca.1435-1460) by Florentine painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-uccello]Paolo Uccello[/url]. Some have also suggested that the central group of figures was inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder]Pieter Bruegel[/url]\u2019s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/parable-of-the-blind-1568][i]The Parable of the Blind[/i][/url] (1568) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/auguste-rodin]Auguste Rodin[/url]\u2019s sculpture [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/auguste-rodin/burghers-of-calais][i]The Burghers of Calais[/i][/url] (1884-1889). [i]Gassed[/i] was first exhibited in 1919 at the Royal Academy in London, and it was voted picture of the year by the Royal Academy of Arts. Although the painting received high praise from Winston Churchill, it also had some notable critics. The novelists E.M. Forster and Virginia Woolf both criticized [i]Gassed[/i] for being naively patriotic. Today the painting belongs to the collection of the Imperial War Museum in London."

Hopper began 'Office in a Small City' while he was staying in Truro in the summer of 1953, and he finished it in his New York studio in the fall. Rather than depicting the Cape Cod landscape, however, 'Office in a Small City' is a scene that could have taken place in any American town in the mid-twentieth century. Hopper's explanation of his earlier work 'Office at Night' (1940; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis) also applies to this painting: \"My aim was to try to give the sense of an isolated and lonely office interior rather high in the air, with the office furniture which has a very definite meaning to me.\"\r\nThe solitary office worker in this scene is isolated both physically and emotionally. There is no indication of his particular profession, as he sits in his shirtsleeves; he appears, in fact, to be daydreaming rather than working. The postwar culture of American business is evident in the mass-produced office furniture, the impersonal atmosphere of the office itself, and the man's detachment from his unseen coworkers. Despite the light and air afforded by his corner office, he appears trapped in place. He is framed by the office window, and his head is profiled against another window and the wall of the building beyond, in a manner that suggests his containment within his environment. The solitude of the man, and the contrast between the stark, utilitarian upper story of the building and its decorative false front, visible at the lower right, suggest Hopper's own ambivalence toward modern urban life."

Two paintings, one by Manet and one by Renoir, done simultaneously on a summer afternoon, capture a moment of peaceful calm in the Monet's garden. In 1924, Monet recounted the circumstances of the day in his garden at Argenteuil: \"Manet, enthralled by the color and the light, undertook an outdoor [url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436965]painting[/url] of figures under trees. During the sitting, Renoir arrived. . . . He asked me for palette, brush and canvas, and there he was, painting away alongside Manet. The latter was watching him out of the corner of his eye. . . . Then he made a face, passed discreetly near me, and whispered in my ear about Renoir: 'He has no talent, that boy! Since you are his friend, tell him to give up painting!'\" However later, as a celebrator of beauty, and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that \"Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau\". While many Impressionist painters focused on landscapes, Renoir painted people in intimate and candid moments. Renoir\u2019s works are also notable for their use of vibrant light and color. His style emphasized freely brushed touches of color, so that his figures softly fuse with one another and their surroundings."

        "description": "[i]Ecce Ancilla Domini! (The Annunciation)[/i] (1849-1850) represents a radical interpretation of the religious subject. Inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/early-renaissance]Early Renaissance[/url] artists like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli]Sandro Botticelli[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/fra-angelico]Fra Angelico[/url], Rossetti presented an unconventional depiction of the Annunciation. Traditionally, the Virgin is seen in a state of deep thought or prayer as the Angel Gabriel usually approaches on bended knee gesturing towards the heavens. In [i]Ecce Ancilla Domini![/i], the Virgin is rising awkwardly from her bed, as if awakened from sleep, while the Angel presents her with a white lily. \n\nThe artist used several models for the painting, including his sister Christina and brother William Michael. The painting is sometimes linked to another work, [URL href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/the-childhood-of-mary-virgin-1849][i]The Girlhood of Mary Virgin[/i][/url] (1848-1849). In the composition, the Virgin Mary is in the company of her parents and the young Angel Gabriel: she is embroidering with her mother while her father is trimming a vine. However, Mary pays little attention to her embroidering; instead, she is surrounded by symbolic objects that prepare her for her future role: the dove that symbolizes the holy spirit, the palm branch, thorns that represent Jesus Christ, and the book that signifies hope, faith, and charity. [i]Ecce Ancilla Domini![/i] continues the story, as Mary learns the purpose of her long preparations.\n\nIn [i]Ecce Ancilla Domini![/i], the composition is dominated by white and blue, the two colors traditionally associated with the Virgin. Both figures wear white, a symbol of the Virgin\u2019s purity, highlighting the bright blue tones in the background. However, unlike traditional pictures that display the figures in a lavish dress, the plain white clothes resemble undergarments. The figures are close in a cramped and narrow space, the Angel Gabriel is seen from the back, and his expression is hard to discern. Even though the Angel has no wings, his role as the messenger of God is emphasized through the presence of the dove, and the light flames under his feet, that give the appearance of levitation. He peculiarly holds the lily, and it seems that the flower is almost a reverse image of the lilies on the red patch of embroidery. Some scholars believe that the placement of the lily contains sexual overtones, as the tip of the flower appears to be pointing towards Mary\u2019s womb. Rossetti probably wanted to subvert the symbolism of the lily: the flower that usually signifies purity can be interpreted as a symbol of Mary\u2019s transition from sexual innocence to sexual awareness.\n\nRossetti intended to make a pendant, companion piece for the painting, showing the Virgin\u2019s death, but this plan never materialized. If [i]Ecce Ancilla Domini![/i] was supposed to be a diptych, it partially explains the tall and narrow format of the painting (72.4 cm \u00d7 41.9 cm). The artwork was exhibited at the National Institution in 1850 and received mixed reviews. One particularly harsh critic wrote: \u201c[i]a work evidently thrust by the artist into the eye of the spectator more with the presumption of a teacher than in the modesty of a hopeful and true aspiration after excellence.[/i]\u201d The painting was bought for by early [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood]Pre-Raphaelite[/url] patron Francis McCracken.

However,the Crucifixion with a Donor, which is attributed to him, is perfectly in line with the iconographic tradition of the 15th century.\n\nThe composition shows a sort of hierarchical intercession procedure. The kneeling donor is praying for his salvation. He is accompanied by his patron, St Peter, identified by the key in his hand. Turning towards St John the Evangelist, St Peter presents his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. St John then looks towards the Virgin, asking her to intercede with her Son, which she does by praying. Christ figures on the cross as a sign of redemption, his sacrifice having made possible the salvation of the human race. The scene is portrayed in the place reserved for the torture of condemned criminals, on the edge of a Brabant city which is visible in the distance. Midway, a broken gibbet lies on the ground, surrounded by scattered bones and crows. Some figures are walking along the paths leading towards a mill to the left and a castle to the right.\n\nThe donor's identity is not known. Only his first name, Peter, is indicated by the presence of his patron saint. He is dressed in a white shirt and a brown pourpoint. Over this he wears a black cape and a hat on his head. His legs are dressed in striped black and red breeches and stockings decorated with the same motif. A sword shows out from under the cape. This costume, which was worn in the Low Countries during the last 20 years of the 15th century, could indicate that the donor was in a lord's service.\n\nWe do not know whether this panel originally had wings. No other crucifixion by Hieronymus Bosch is known, although the theme returns as a secondary motif in others of his paintings. It is also one of the master's few works containing a donor portrait. The style displays a striking balance and serenity. The flesh colours of Christ's body are softened and the draperies sober. The countryside shows a very gentle gradation of greens, producing a successful effect of depth.\n\n[url href=https://www.wga.hu/]WGA[/url]"

Missouri native Thomas Hart Benton painted [i]America Today[/i] to adorn a boardroom on the third floor of the New School for Social Research, a center of progressive thought and education in Greenwich Village. The mural was commissioned in 1930 by the New School's director Alvin Johnson. Benton finished it very early in 1931, when the school opened a new building designed by architect Joseph Urban. Although the artist received no fee for his work on commission, he was \"paid\" with free eggs, the yolks from which he created the egg tempera paint.\n\nEight of the [i]America Today[/i] panels depict life in different regions of the United States: the South, the Midwest, the West, and New York. In the 1920s, Benton traveled throughout these areas of the country, creating a body of studies from life, mostly in pencil, on which he based many of the details in [i]America Today[/i]. Benton painted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-hart-benton/cotton-pickers-georgia-1929][i]Cotton Pickers, Georgia[/i][/url] (1929) from the studies that he made during a trip through Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia in the summer and fall of 1926. The artist returned to this same group of studies in conceiving and executing [i]Deep South[/i] (1931), the first panel in [i]America Today[/i]'s geographical and chronological sweep.\n\nThe largest [i]America Today[/i] panel, [i]Instruments of Power[/i], is filled with enormous machines that embody modern industrial might. The last and smallest panel, [i]Outreaching Hands[/i], shows only hands reaching for bread and other hands holding money, allusions to the economic despair and inequity caused by the Great Depression, which began in 1929. Despite references to the Depression, Benton's mural powerfully promotes the idea of \"progress,\" as he perceived it, predicated on modern technology. Benton's mural reveals the artist's belief that the foundational technological and mechanical strength on which progress relied was, in turn, dependent on manual and industrial labor. Consequently, bodies of large, heroic workers fill many of the mural's panels. Workers and labor fascinated many artists and photographers throughout the 1920s, including Lewis Hine (1987.1100.119) and James Lesesne Wells (1999.529.173).\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to these dramatic scenes of labor and struggle, Benton depicted in City Activities with Dance Hall (2012.478b) and\u3000City Activities with Subway (2012.478c) popular leisure-time activities during Prohibition (1920\u201333), particularly dancing (to jazz music) and drinking (illegal at the time). The bawdiness of Benton's scenes of urban life connects them to the work of his friend Reginald Marsh (32.81.2), who recalled modeling for the figure of the African American construction worker in the City Building\u3000(2012.478i) panel of America Today. Jackson Pollock, Benton's student at the Art Students League at the time, modeled for other workers, including the large figure in the panelSteel\u3000(2012.478h). In the 1940s, Pollock became a leader of the Abstract Expressionist movement.\n\n\n\n\nBenton created America Today in a dynamic, restlessly figurative style that reflects his study of sixteenth-century European painting, especially the style known as Mannerism (1972.171). But the exaggerated, pantomimed gestures and expressions of the figures he painted also recall early twentieth-century film, among other popular sources. Also stagelike in character is Benton's depiction of architecture, particularly the dam in Instruments of Power (2012.478a), a facade that suggests his response to Italian painter Giorgio de Chirico (1996.403.10). Among the mural's most distinctive features are the aluminum-leaf wood moldings, which not only frame the entire work but also create inventive spatial breaks within each large composition. When America Today was installed in the New School, these moldings echoed Art Deco details in Urban's building design.\n\n\n\n\nAfter appearing on the cover of Time magazine in 1934, Benton left New York and settled in Kansas City, Missouri the following year. Throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s, he became closely associated with a movement known as Regionalism, which included John Steuart Curry (42.154) and Grant Wood (50.117), artists who exalted rural America and tended to regard contemporary abstract art as un-American. During this period, Benton painted July Hay (43.159.1), a work that reflects his admiration for the sixteenth-century Netherlandish artist Pieter Bruegel (19.164).\n\n\n\n\nAfter residing for more than fifty years in the boardroom of the New School, America Today proved difficult for the school to maintain in perpetuity. In 1982, the school announced the sale of the mural, with the condition that it would not be resold outside the United States or as individual panels. But the work was a great challenge to sell as a whole, increasing the likelihood that the panels would be dispersed.\n\n\n\n\nAmerica Today was acquired by AXA (then Equitable Life) in 1984, in support of efforts on the part of then-mayor Edward I. Koch and others to keep it intact and in New York City. Two years later, after extensive cleaning and restoration, America Today was unveiled to critical acclaim in AXA's new headquarters at 787 Seventh Avenue. When the company moved its corporate headquarters again in 1996, to 1290 Avenue of the Americas, America Today was put on display in the lobby. There it remained until January 2012, when the company was asked to remove it to make way for a renovation. The removal triggered AXA's decision to place the historic work in a museum collection, and in December 2012, AXA donated the mural to the Metropolitan Museum."

Years later, in 1934, he and his wife built a house and studio in South Truro, Massachusetts, where he produced a number of oil paintings and watercolors manifesting his avid interest in nautical subjects.\n\nDespite its bright palette and seemingly serene subject, Ground Swell echoes the themes of loneliness and escape typical of Hopper's oeuvre. The blue sky, sun-kissed figures, and vast rolling water strike a calm note in the picture; however, the visible disengagement of the figures from each other and their noticeable preoccupation with the bell buoy placed at the center of the canvas call into question this initial sense of serenity. The lone dark element in a sea of blues and whites, the buoy confronts the small catboat in the middle of an otherwise empty seascape. Its purpose, to emit a warning sound in advance of unseen or imminent danger, renders its presence in the picture ominous. The cirrus clouds in the blue sky\u2014often harbingers of approaching storms\u2014reinforce this sense of disturbance in the otherwise peaceful setting. Although Hopper resisted offering explanations of his paintings, the signs of impending danger here may also reference a more severe disturbance: during the time that Hopper worked on Ground Swell, from August to September 15, 1939, World War II broke out in Europe."

The painting was commissioned to Renoir by the dealer Durand-Ruel, who represented him at the time and who had been favorably impressed by that first draft. The model is Aline Charigot, the artist's partner and then wife, who poses for him on several occasions, while the background alludes, according to Renoir himself, to the bay of Naples. The canvas marks an important change in the painter's work, which began with a trip to Italy and the encounter with ancient art and the works of Raphael. This experience led him to develop drawings with more defined contours and particularly sculptural forms which in the painting are associated with the still impressionistic rendering of the surrounding natural space.\n\n(Description taken and translated from: [url href=https://www.pinacoteca-agnelli.it/collezione/la-baigneuse-blonde/]https://www.pinacoteca-agnelli.it/collezione/la-baigneuse-blonde/[/url])"

Facing him is Guido Cavalcanti (about 1255-1300), acclaimed for his love sonnets. The standing figure in clerical garb is the humanist and classical scholar Francesco Petrarch (1304-74); to his right is Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-75), author of the Decameron. The figures at the far left are two authoritative commentators on their works, the humanist and man of letters Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499) and the platonic philosopher Cristoforo Landino (1424-1498/1504). All four wear laurel wreaths, symbolic of literary achievement. The objects on the table represent various scholarly disciplines.

This emphasises the mass of the hill and provides an unusual view of the White Horse cut into the chalk at Uffington in Berkshire, one of Britain\u2019s most ancient sites. It was, perhaps, the surprisingly abstract depiction of the White Horse that attracted modern artists."

Ornamentation on the shrine includes gold- and silver-embossed, fire-gilded figures, filigree panels set with precious and semi-precious stones, intaglios, and cameos, and columns, arches and profiles trimmed with enamels. The images depicted on the shrine include scenes from the history of salvation from the dawning of time to the Last Judgment. Although the shrine was shortened by one axis after being hidden from French revolutionary troops in 1794, it was largely restored to its original shape during the most recent period of restoration, which lasted from 1961 to 1973. The intention in the Middle Ages was that the shrine would be placed in the crossing. Today, however, it rises above the medieval high altar at the back of the inner choir, making this area the main focus of the Gothic cathedral, which was built as a stone reliquary for this precious shrine."

        "description": "This complex and multi-coloured composition was painted by Agar in 1933-4, while she was living at 47 Bramham Gardens, Earls Court, London. Although not yet part of the Surrealist movement she was aware of ideas being promulgated by the group. Her idiosyncratic juxtaposition of ideas and images, which had first emerged in Three Symbols (Tate T00707), was developed further in The Autobiography of an Embryo.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal painting is divided into four sections with a decorative border running along the top and bottom of the canvas. The composition is reminiscent of the arrangement of a classical wall painting, with winged putti on top of the dividing columns. A Greco-Roman influence is also evident in the abstract shapes and patterns. Draped figures, which recall antiques statues, and the geometric patterns similarly echo the decoration on ancient Greek vessels.\r\n\r\nSuch an array of symbols evokes a cultural heritage. In the second section the head of a African woman resembles African sculptures and a head seen in profile refers to Italian Renaissance portraiture. More specifically, the squat figure who appears twice in the first two sections, represents Ubu, a character in the French play of 1896 by Alfred Jarry. These quotations are combined with modern elements, such as the brick wall in the second section and the graffitti-like head on the far right.\r\n\r\nOrganic and biological forms run through the composition. Agar may have taken her lead from the Czech painter Franticek Foltyn, who taught her in Paris, and who incorporated similar motifs into his work. Shells and winged forms are combined with plant-like structures, and circular shapes suggest fossils, cells or embryonic forms. Agar apparently kept a fish tank in the 1930s and was intrigued by the aquariums at the zoos in London and Naples. In her autobiography (pp. 84-5) she noted that when living in Paris she had frequently visited the Jardin des Plantes, where she became fascinated by 'the bones of that protobird, the Archaeopteryx'. This may relate to the winged structure in the third segment. She added, 'I was enthralled by fossils, their muted colour and embedded beauty. They reach us as signals in time, isolated objects which take on the importance of a problem resolved at some moment far back beyond the mists of human memory. I learnt about the secrets of animal structure and from there my thoughts led easily to the problem of human structure' (quoted in Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1986-88, p.240). This connection was made more concrete when Agar discovered that 'human foetuses have gills for about 12 weeks because in the evolution of our species we went though an amphibian stage' (quoted in Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1986-88, p.240).

The horses which dominate the picture are the heavy grey mounts used by the regiment throughout its history until mechanization. Two hundred men and 224 horses of the Greys were killed or wounded during the charge portrayed.\nDuring the First World War both the Germans and the British used this image in their propaganda material."

His wife had to open a dress shop in order to help provide for the family. These hardships were compounded when Matisse and his wife, Amelie, were found to be scapegoats for a conspiracy involving Amelie\u2019s mother, a housekeeper for the Humbert family. Amelie was forced to close her shop, and Matisse was left to provide for his entire family again. This can partially explain Matisse\u2019s shift during this time to more saleable canvases. "

He ordered his men to stop the bombing, this saving the painting and the town from annihilation.

        "description": "This famous painting at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie was an order Andr\u00e9 Derain received from Paul Guillaume. Derain chose to depict two characters from the Italian theatre known as the Commedia dell\u2019Arte: Harlequin in his colourful chequered costume and bicorn hat, and Pierrot in his white frock with ruff, head covered by a black calotte. Amongst the painters, Paul C\u00e9zanne (1839-1906), Auguste Renoir (1841-1919) and Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) had already taken an interest in this theme of saltimbanques that had been popular since the 16th century.\nNonetheless, Derain created an original work: Harlequin and Pierrot, with one knee raised and both playing the guitar, appear against a neutral background in a never-ending dance like marionettes or puppets. Their gazes do not meet and they have serious expressions on their faces. Therefore the painting is suffused with a certain melancholy quality. Derain prepared for this work by making several preliminary drawings. He also paid close attention to the small still life in the bottom right of the painting that anchors the composition. The figure of Pierrot was finally recognised as a portrait of Paul Guillaume.\nThis painting appeared several times during the lifetime of its sponsor. It can be seen in a photograph of his flat on Avenue de Messine. Derain alluded to this painting in the background of a portrait of Domenica Guillaume that he painted between 1928-1929 and that is conserved at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie.

The picture may be viewed as both an homage to Spain's past and a statement on the political upheaval in Europe. In subtle ways, Mir\u00f3's works frequently expressed his own political sentiments as does this one as well as works from the period leading up to and throughout World War II. The painting also emphasizes how extremely radical was Mir\u00f3's departure from his previous, naturalist style once he arrived in Paris and was exposed to the avant-garde art of that city in which innovation thrived."

Gilt lotus flowers of a red base sway in the midst of a mass of green leaves; the grain of the petals and the veins of the leaves are defined with long hard lines.

Fort Edmonton demonstrates Kane\u2019s use of the picturesque style in which elevated viewpoints and sinuous land formations allow the viewer to \u201ctravel\u201d through the image.\r\n\r\nPaul Sandby, Harlech Castle in Merioneth Shire with Snowdon at a Distance, 1776, etching and aquatint in sanguine on ivory laid paper, 23.9 x 31.5 cm (plate); 32 x 46.3 cm (sheet), National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. Sandby (1731\u20131809) was a well-known practitioner of the picturesque style in England\r\n          Although Kane spent extended periods at Hudson\u2019s Bay Company (HBC) posts, there are no pictorial records of the interior of the forts. As the art historian J. Russell Harper notes, the artist\u2019s panoramic views of the company\u2019s presence in the landscape reinforce the sense of its empire.  With its palisades and corner towers, and its situation on a promontory overlooking the North Saskatchewan River, Fort Edmonton must have seemed to Kane the New World equivalent to an Old World castle such as Harlech in North Wales, which is similarly situated on a rock overlooking water. Kane in his early days had copied a print (as yet unidentified) of Harlech Castle.\r\n          Kane made two pencil sketches of the fort as seen from a distance: one from the southeast  and one from the south.  For this oil painting, Kane chose the view from the south, in which the fort is approached by a path running alongside the river. Here Kane was confronted by a scene with two parallel foci: the river extending into the distance on the left and the path culminating in the fort on the right. Kane\u2019s challenge was to resolve the split focus into a picturesque view. This he did by incorporating clouds into the upper left quadrant to create a sweeping \u201cS\u201d that moves the viewer\u2019s eye across the foreground, onto the promontory, creating contact with the horizon and into the sky and distance. \r\n          Current understandings of the picturesque often situate it within the framework of an imperialist ideology. If Fort Edmonton is looked at through this lens, then Kane\u2019s recognition of the economic relationship between empire and colony can also be seen in his inclusion of the fort, the teepees, and the river that was so important to the fur trade\u2014elements included in both his sketches and his preparatory drawings."

The cat looks rather disgruntled and its claws are bared, yet the pose of the young boy and the confidence of the little girl suggest that they are unaware that at any moment, chaos could break loose.\n\nChildren were often used at this time to illustrate bad or improper behaviour. Art historian Cynthia Kortenhorst-Von Bogendorf Rupprath suggests that this painting represents a Dutch proverb which translates as: \"he who plays with the cat gets scratched, meaning he who looks for trouble gets it.\" The little girl's gesture seems to confirm this idea, as if she actively trying to get the viewer to contemplate this lesson. However, as with The Carousing Couple, there is something rather charming in their pink cheeks and smiles, even if they are behaving badly."

At the bottom left there is a stream and a small waterfall, and on the right in the middle, on the branches there is a bright green lizard. The plot of the picture was explained by the art critic Andrei Ivanovich Somov, who saw the work in 1883 at the 11th exhibition of the Itinerants and gave it a rather detailed description: \u201cA. Kharlamov sent three works to the exhibition from Paris, generally not bad, but adding nothing to the reputation of the \"Russian Bonn\" he had created. At the sight of his 'The Italian Girl Swinging a Tambourine at a Lizard', ... you ask yourself: was it worth taking this large canvas for such an insignificant plot, was it worth spending so much paint on it and flaunting it like that? \"\n\nBut if the plot seemed insignificant to the Russian critic, the responses in the French press were different. Thus, the French critic T. Veron, who saw the work in the previous year, 1882 at the exhibition of the Salon in Paris, wrote in his review: \u201cAn unexpected meeting with a beautiful green lizard crawling on branches in matte or reddened autumn. This is a meeting of a small Italian woman in profile, who is looking at the emerald of a small lizard. In excitement, she tosses her tambourine with silver bells into the air and gives them a cat concert. The image of this girl swinging at a thick and reddish tree is very attractive. A. Kharlamov is a hot and powerful colorist. \"\n\nNow, more than a century later, the outlines of a figure are clearly visible behind the girl's back. Kharlamov either initially introduced another character, and then for some reason wrote it down, or the position of the girl's figure on the canvas was different. This to some extent explains the artist's miscalculations both in the drawing of her hand, which looks unnaturally short, and in the position of the figure, which stands strictly in the center and leaned back a little. By the way, these errors in the picture were immediately noticed by the critics of that time. Thus, the critic Vladimir Sizov argued that \"from a technical point of view, the picture seems unfinished.\" \n\n[b]Details[/b]\n\n- The plot of this work is explained by a more complete title, which was mentioned by the artist's contemporary critic Somov: \u201cAn Italian girl swinging a tambourine\n\n- Now, more than a century later, the outlines of another figure are clearly visible behind the girl's back.

He was able to overcome his challenge, however, to the benefit of his color palette, which he would take with him throughout the rest of his paintings.

Sargent's friendship with Monet developed during his student days at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and he visited Monet's home in Giverny multiple times during the 1880s. In this painting, Sargent employs Monet's en plein air technique to depict his friend painting nature directly outdoors, with Monet's wife Alice sitting patiently in the background.\n\nWhile the image on Monet's easel shows a sky scene, Sargent focuses more on the two figures and the interplay of light on the grass and trees. This impressionistic style is quite different from Sargent's more realistic approach to portraiture. Nevertheless, the painting's exploration of the relationship between Monet and Alice exemplifies Sargent's strength as an artist, that of capturing the dynamics of human relationships in his works."

        "description": "The genre of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]self-portraiture[/url] fully developed in Western painting during the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Renaissance[/url]. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]D\u00fcrer\u2019s self-portraits[/url] are not only among the earliest examples of the genre, but are also some of the finest works of self-portraiture ever produced in Western art.  [i]Self Portrait at the Age of Twenty Eight[/i] (1500) is particularly significant; it is an artistic proclamation that is deeply tied to how Durer wanted to position himself in the context of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/northern-renaissance#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]Northern Renaissance[/url] and the Humanist movement.\n\nThe self-portrait gave D\u00fcrer the opportunity to display the breadth of his technical skill, particularly in creating the textures of his luscious hair and rich fur. It is likely that the portrait remained in D\u00fcrer\u2019s cabinet, exhibited in private viewings to impress prospective clients and used for demonstrations to his students. In the self-portrait, the artist adorns a fashionable brown coat with a fur trim, a garment worn by 15th century noblemen. The garment is a symbol of social status, and indicates D\u00fcrer\u2019s climb on the social ladder. This also represents the new status of artists in the Renaissance, where they were elevated from anonymity, and recognized publicly as creators and not mere craftsmen. The self-portrait is accompanied by the inscription: [i]\u201cI, Albrecht Durer of Nuremberg painted myself thus, with undying colors, at the age of twenty eight years\u201d[/i]. In the Medieval era, the age twenty eight signified the transition to maturity. The inscription plays up this symbolism, signifying the artist entering a new era.\n\nThe frontal portrait is highly unusual for a secular portrait. It deliberately invites the comparison to the image of Christ, particularly to the iconography of Christ as [i]Salvator Mundi[/i] (Savior of the World). The self-portrait evokes the concept of [i]Imitatio Christi[/i], the ideal of imitating and following the Christ. It is possible that D\u00fcrer emphasized the biblical idea that Man was created in God\u2019s image, and through the self-portrait he was asserting that his creativity originates in divine grace. However, D\u00fcrer\u2019s use of religious iconography also expresses humanist values. The frontal portrait exemplifies symmetry and harmony, ideals praised by ancient writers such as Cicero and Vitruvius, and promoted by Italian Renaissance humanist Leon Battista Alberti. D\u00fcrer, and in particularly this self-portrait, were praised by German Renaissance humanist, Konrad Celtes. \n\nD\u00fcrer and Celtes, along with other German humanists were proponents of the Northern Renaissance, and had the ambition to bring forward a cultural Golden Age. In a text addressed to D\u00fcrer, Celtes links him to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url], a renowned painter of Ancient Greece. Celtes called D\u00fcrer the \u201csecond Apelles\u201d, and indeed in the self-portrait D\u00fcrer presents himself as a Christian Apelles. The dark and minimal color scheme of the self-portrait may have been inspired by Apelles, who was celebrated for his four color system of painting and his dark, glossy glaze. Therefore, [i]Self Portrait at the Age of Twenty Eight[/i] can be understood as an artistic statement, D\u00fcrer absorbing the praise of his contemporaries and reaffirming his position as the \u201cnew Apelles\u201d of the Northern Renaissance."

The beginnings of a second figure in pencil are also visible on the canvas.\r\nAlthough unfinished, the large-scale oil painting, measuring 5ft by 8ft, appears to show Turner's attempt at portraiture in the style of the old masters.\r\nThe image echoes Titian's 1538 portrait, Venus of Urbino, depicting a nude woman reclining on a bed, which hangs in the Uffizi gallery in Florence.\r\nIan Warrell, a Turner expert and the curator of 18th and 19th century art at Tate Britain, said: \"This portrait will stop people in their tracks because it is so completely different to the image of Turner's works that everyone has in their minds.\r\n\"We see him primarily as a painter of landscapes, light and atmosphere, and so to see him attempt such an unusual subject, consciously trying to develop that portrait style of Titian and the masters, is a radical departure from the landscapes and shipwrecks with which he is so closely associated.\""

        "description": "American artists who were intent on describing the spectacle of contemporary life during the first decades of the twentieth century often chose circus themes and clowns as their subjects. John Sloan, Everett Shinn, Walt Kuhn, and George Luks were among the many painters who identified with clowns, whom they saw as critics, outcasts, or enchanters-roles also filled by artists. Luks was no stranger to the kind of entertainment provided by clowns and even to the makeup they wore. In his late teens and early twenties, Luks and his brother, Will, had toured Pennsylvania and New Jersey with a minstrel show in an act called \u201cBuzzey and Anstock\u201d in which they sang, played guitar, and told jokes, performing in full costume with face paint. Even Luks\u2019s behavior had clownish aspects: a heavy-drinker, inveterate story-teller, and street brawler, Luks was described by his fellow Ashcan painter, Everett Shinn, as \u201ca circus in one\u201d and \u201cthe clown who had found the circus ring too small and had dragged his antics out into the streets,\u201d (\u201cEverett Shinn on George Luks: An Unpublished Memoir,\u201d Archives of American Art, April 1966, p. 5).\r\n\r\nLuks\u2019s immediate inspiration to paint \u201cA Clown\u201d may have been the success of an exhibition entitled \u201cCircus in Paint,\u201d which Juliana Force had organized at the Whitney Studio Club in April 1929. He also may have been motivated by a visit to a fair in Hadlyme, Connecticut in the late 1920s (Pierre Th\u00e9berge, \u201cThe Great Parade: Portrait of the Artist as Clown,\u201d New Haven, Yale University Press, 2004, p. 155). However, circus themes were part of Luks\u2019s work much earlier in his career when he had been an artist-reporter, cartoonist, and illustrator. \u201cCircus Scene\u201d (gouache, Sordoni Art Gallery, Wilkes College) from 1895 shows a clown confronting a little boy. A cartoon by Luks entitled \u201cThe Animals Start a Circus and Make the Men Perform\u201d appeared in the April 12, 1896 edition of the \u201cNew York World.\u201d In 1911 he painted (and then altered in 1923) a portrait entitled \u201cJack and Russell Burke\u201d (Museum of Art Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute), in which the young boys are dressed in bright orange and yellow clown costumes. Luks continued with circus themes after 1929. In about 1932 he painted \u201cEntr\u2019acte\u201d (location unknown) showing a kindly-looking clown holding a boy on his lap. As with his street urchins and old women, Luks painted his clowns sympathetically. He clearly identified with these circus performers who made people laugh but were serious and perhaps melancholic within.\r\n\r\nContrary to the usual perception of the Big Top performer and to Luks\u2019s own reputation as a joker and comedian, Luks depicted the figure in \u201cA Clown\u201d as dignified and serious. He seems to be seated on a couch conversing with an unseen companion. To evoke the atmosphere of a circus, Luks employed brilliant color in defined shapes that form a decorative abstract pattern around the clown\u2019s head; the daisy he holds is the only note of whimsy. The resulting image is striking, and as a result, Luk\u2019s painting was chosen as the cover image for the magazine \u201cThe Arts\u201d in May 1930. In turn, painter Jan Matulka used that journal as one of the elements in his own \u201cStill Life Composition\u201d in about 1933 or 1934 (Smithsonian American Art Museum), probably to pay tribute to the older artist who had given him much needed encouragement early in his career, (Edward Alden Jewell, \u201cJan Matulka,\u201d New York Times, March 3, 1929, p. X13).\r\n\r\nJohn T. Spaulding, a Boston collector whose family made their fortune from sugar refining, bought \u201cA Clown\u201d from Luks\u2019s New York dealer, Frank K. M. Rehn. Spaulding paid the princely sum of $4,000 (almost $50,000 in today\u2019s currency) for the painting in December 1929, just two months after the stock market crash. He bequeathed \u201cA Clown\u201d to the MFA with the rest of his outstanding collection in 1948. Today Luks\u2019s bold image has lost none of its power -\u201cA Clown\u201d was chosen for the cover of \u201cThe Great Parade: Portrait of the Artist as Clown,\u201d an exhibition catalogue from 2004."

All three pictures are based on a series of pen and ink sketches produced during a trip to Paris in 1843-4. On 2 May 1848 Brown saw William Charles Macready (1793-1873) in a production of the play, and began work on this picture in November of the same year.\r\nThe painting illustrates Act IV, Scene VII from the play. Brown used models for most of the figures, but the head of Lear was inspired by 'a cast of Dante's and a drawing of Coulton' . He used his favourite model, Maitland, for the soldiers on the right, and his new pupil and friend, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, for the fool, who holds Lear in his sinister stare. He modelled the head of Cordelia on his own wife-to-be, Emma, but the hands were those of a professional model, Mrs Ashley. In order to render the spirit of Shakespeare's play, he chose to dress his figures in the costume of the 6th century when, according to Brown himself, as noted in his 1865 catalogue, 'paganism was still rife, and deeds were at their darkest.' Behind Lear's head he includes a detail from on of the main scenes in the Bayeux Tapestry.\r\nThe picture was first shown at the Free Exhibition in 1849, where it was well received, but remained unsold. Brown continued to work on the picture intermittently until 1854, when it was bought by John Seddon the architect for 15 guineas."

This painting, Fruit Bowl, Glass and Apples had belonged to Paul Gauguin, who is also evoked among the tutelary examples to whom Denis is paying homage. Effectively, a painting by Gauguin and another by Renoir can be made out in the background. Odilon Redon is also given pride of place: he is shown in the foreground on the far left and most of the figures are looking at him. He is listening to Paul S\u00e9rusier who is standing in front of him. From left to right, we can recognise Edouard Vuillard, the critic Andr\u00e9 Mellerio in a top hat, Vollard behind the easel, Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Pierre Bonnard smoking a pipe, and lastly Marthe Denis, the painter's young wife. Part of the Nabi generation is gathered here in a composition which follows on from the homage paid by Fantin-Latour in several paintings, especially A Studio at Les Batignolles in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.\r\nWhen Maurice Denis exhibited his work in Paris and Brussels in 1901, reactions were sometimes hostile. In his diary, the artist referred to it as \"that painting, which still makes the public laugh\". His friend, the writer Andr\u00e9 Gide, immediately offered to buy it. He did not part with it until 1928 when he gave it to the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg."

        "description": "The composition for [i]Battle of Britain[/i] was inspired by a 19th-century lithograph showing a storm over Paris, which Nash's wife Margaret had shown to her husband's pupil, Richard Seddon. At first glance, the coastal landscape, brilliant blue sky, and carefully rendered cloud formations dominate this painting, which takes a view from Britain in the foreground - across the English Channel - to France in the background. However, it soon becomes apparent that the scene is set in the midst of an aerial battle, the Battle of Britain, and that the landscape is under attack. Entwined with the clouds are the trailing paths of airplanes, whilst darker trails of smoke are signs of combat and of damaged, sometimes falling planes. At least one of these black smoke trails was not painted by Nash but by his student, Richard Seddon, who advised his teacher that he should add more of these destructive marks to the work.\n\nNash painted this work during the battle itself, explaining that it contains characteristic elements such as the winding river across the parched countryside, the cumulus clouds after a summer day, and the trails of airplanes in the sky, both those that are still flying and those that are burnt and falling. The Germain air force (Luftwaffe) can be seen advancing in formation, whilst - in a midst of vapor trails, cloud, smoke, parachutes, and balloons - British RAF pilots break up these forces at the center of the painting. The British planes rise almost from the earth itself, lending the landscape more grandeur, poetry, and dignity than is seen in Nash's earlier, more devastating paintings.\n\nCharacteristic of Nash's work at this time, the painting is not entirely true to life but takes on an imaginative and symbolic edge, which in part is demonstrated by discrepancies in scale between the action in the sky and the landscape below. Rather than render a particular, realistic battle scene, the painting speaks of large-scale, dramatic aerial conflict. Nash wrote, \"[i]The painting is an attempt to give the sense of an aerial battle in operation over a wide area and thus summarises England's great aerial victory over Germany.[/i]\" In this sense, it could be considered a patriotic work.\n\n[url href=https://www.theartstory.org/artist/nash-paul/artworks/][b]by TheArtStory[/b][/url]"

The artist utilizes the atypical square format employed by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez in Las Meninas (1656) and adopts the Spanish painter's approach of capturing the natural essence of his subjects to convey their personalities.\n\nThe arrangement of the figures deviates from the conventional group portrait where each individual holds an equal standing. Instead, the girls are positioned seemingly at random throughout the dimly lit, ornately furnished room, surrounded by two large blue and white porcelain vases. Three of the four girls gaze directly at the viewer, while the fourth faces her sister, who wears a matching black and white outfit. The youngest daughter (Julia, aged 4) sits informally on the floor, in stark contrast to the older girls who stand stiffly behind her. The two eldest sisters (Jane, 12, and Florence, 14) are partially obscured in shadow as they stand in the doorway leading to another room. Several critics have observed that the painting transcends its function as a group portrait to symbolize the loss of innocence associated with growing up. Sargent's depiction suggests how people often conceal their true selves behind a fa\u00e7ade of manners and etiquette, evoking the restrictive social norms that upper-class women of the time were raised under."

Its rich, refined and predominately warm color scheme corresponds to Coello\u2019s most powerful period, free of the earlier dependence on Rizi still visible in the large San Pl\u00e1cido Annunciation from 1668, and of the influence of Carre\u00f1o that is also noticeable in his 1676 Immaculate Conception at the Mus\u00e9e de Castres. So this canvas is from the artist\u2019s most advanced period, with colors, a model and technique close to other works from his finest and most fully mature period, such as the Magdalene from the Ciempozuelos altarpiece (1682) and the Saint Catherine (1683) at the Wellington Museum in London."

        "description": "[i]Strawberry Thief[/i] is the best known of Morris's decorative textile designs, one on which he worked for several months before finding a way of printing it successfully. The fabric was intended to be used for curtains or hung along walls, a medieval style of decoration which the artist advocated. The pattern, meanwhile, was based on the thrushes that would steal strawberries from the kitchen in his country home at Kelmscott Manner and was therefore imbued with nostalgic sentiment. While the foliate designs are intricate and eye-catching, and the general design provides little depth between foreground and background, the birds remain a focal point due to their light color and the naturalism of their rendering. They also create an element of narrative interest, as the mischievous protagonists of a story that plays out across the surface of the fabric, entertaining with their song. At the same time, they make away with the precious berries.\n\nThese themes are redolent of the [i]natura naturans[/i] spirit of much medieval textile art and loosely evocative of the romance and fantasy narratives of the same era. In practical terms, Morris took a great deal of interest in the craftsmanship of the [i]Strawberry Thief[/i] design, learning the theory of fabric-dyeing and block-printing to create a pattern amenable to his chosen production process. Eventually, he settled on the ancient technique of indigo discharge, despite its costly and laborious nature, applying bleached blocks to the dyed fabric. His main concern was the depth of color in the finished product and the artisanal authenticity of the creative process.\n\nThis design has attained extraordinary commercial success since its release in the late 19th century. It continues to sell widely, with English department stores having featured it in several high-end fashion collaborations. Its popularity has recently led the Victoria and Albert Museum's designer-in-residence to create a digital game based on the design. At the same time, contemporary artists continue to look back to it. The conceptual and video artist Jeremy Deller, for example, has named an exhibition after the work and created the piece [i]Strawberry Thief[/i] (2014), a neon light depicting one of the birds with a captured berry, in homage to it."

Due to Rivera\u2019s controversial Marxist philosophy, the murals were criticized by the clergy, politicians and the public, 10,000 of whom visited the murals in a single day. The clergy members, who were invited to come and criticize the work, determined that it was a parody of the birth of Christ and demanded that it be destroyed. But Edsel Ford and the Detroit Institute of Arts defended the murals, which were eventually allowed to stay. Later, during the anti-communistic era of the 1950\u2019s a large sign was placed outside the entrance to the murals, defending their artistic merit, all the while decrying Rivera\u2019s politics as \u201cdetestable.\u201d"

The brilliant light and color of this scene, originally titled \"Sketch\u20134th of July in Virginia,\" contradict its more solemn meaning. The central figure is being dressed as Harlequin, the clown and social outcast of European comic theater. The strips of cloth being sewn to his costume, however, derive from African ceremonial dress and from the festival of Jonkonnu, when slaves left their quarters to dance at their master's house. In the years following the Civil War, aspects of Jonkonnu became part of the celebration of the Fourth of July and Emancipation. Here, the pageantry of multihued costumes suggests a festive celebration, but it also reflects the dislocation of traditional African culture and the beginnings of its transformation into a new tradition."

According to Vasari, in his biography of Raphael, his death was brought on by a sudden illness, which was caused by a night of excessive sex with Luti. Being embarrassed and not disclosing this fact to his doctors, he subsequently received the wrong treatment and died two weeks later. "

Between the five proposals, in the spring of 2006, the jury chose a design of Sigmar Polke. He crafted seven windows in the nave from agate, re-establishing the early Middle Ages tradition to produce the church windows out of cut stones (mainly, alabaster). Polke cut this semi-precious stone into thin slices that would let light pass through them and give the appearance of brightly glowing walls. The brilliantly colorful result was then expanded with five figurative glass windows. The motifs feature Old Testament figures: the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/der-sundenbock-2009]scapegoat[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/isaaks-opferung-2009]Isaac[/url], the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/menschensohn-2009]Son of Man[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/elijas-himmelfahrt-2009]Elijah[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/konig-david-2009]David[/url]. They all move in the direction of the birth of Christ and thus toward the chancel window created by Augusto Giacometti in 1933.\n\nPolke's formidable career was bookended with work in glass. He began his artistic training in 1959 as an apprentice in a glass-painting workshop, and he completed the Grossm\u00fcnster windows a year before his death."

Magritte likely borrowed the pipe motif from Le Corbusier's book 'Vers une architecture' (1923), since he was admirer of the architect and painter, but he may also have been inspired by a comical sign he knew in an art gallery, which read, \"Ceci n'est pas de l'Art.\" The painting is the subject of a famous book-length analysis by Michel Foucault.

Even the girl herself is not yet fully dressed, wearing only a petticoat. All these little composition decisions come together to tell us that this girl is someplace between being a child and a woman, and she knows it.\n\nThe actress Jane Russell looks up at the girl from the magazine page, and the girl looks at herself in the mirror, framing her face with her hands as if asking herself: \"but will I ever be like her?\" Rockwell transformed this simple scene into something universal. He made more than 300 covers for the [i]Post[/i], without repeating himself, for 47 years. Each of its models embodies a nuance, a question, an idea of American people. Rockwell managed to break the boundary between illustration and significant arts, creating images capable of speaking to the heart, to the intelligence and experience of people, just like the great works of art exhibited in museums, resistant to time."

Of the small number of paintings she produced during that period, most had religious themes and the majority were bust portraits of the Virgin Mary or people in prayer. All of her works from the period tended toward conservatism, although the pictures were produced in her distinctive style.\n\n[i]Suzanne Bathing[/i] marks Lempicka's return to painting sensual, nude women, although the theme is still emphatically religious: it is a story from the [i]Old Testament[/i]. The story was a favorite of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] artists and its underlying emphasis is on voyeurism. In the story, two judges, well-respected elders, spy on the virtuous Susanna as she bathes. In contrast to some of her earlier images of women who revel in the awareness of their sexuality and the power it confers, subjects who make direct eye contact with the viewer, Lempicka's Susanna, this modern Suzanne, looks away and huddles forward into herself in a gesture of modesty. She clutches a portion of the white cloth resting near her as though she may at any moment pull it toward her to cover herself. Is this the moment in which she discovers she is being observed?\n\nInterestingly, whereas her earlier works tended to depict women against the dramatic skyline of a modern, mechanized city, here Suzanne is shown against a pastoral background of trees. This painting signals the beginning of an era of more conservative works. Her artistic output during this second half of her career is far less openly sensual."

It was first designed as an image for a tapestry in 1748, and was one in a set of six images depicting Noble Pastorales. Originally, tapestries were woven directly over the paintings, and later, they were cut up into sections to be sold separately.

I am not steady on my feet.\u201d Her relationship with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alfred-stieglitz]Alfred Stieglitz[/url] deteriorated and she was suffering health problems. O\u2019Keeffe wanted to take a break from New York, so in 1929, she departed to visit New Mexico. This decision was just the beginning of a powerful romance that lasted until her death.\n \nDuring her travels, O\u2019Keeffe wrote: \u201cI never feel at home in the East like I do out here. And finally feeling in the right place again \u2013I feel like myself\u2013 and I like it.\u201d She resided in the West till the summer of 1930, and produced over 30 paintings there. But it was not until 1935 that she painted [i]Ram\u2019s Head, White Hollyhock-Hills[/i].\n \nThis artwork distills much of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/precisionism]Precisionism[/url], and also of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url]. The juxtaposition of a skull and the landscape of New Mexico was something never seen before. For O\u2019Keeffe, those bones became an important subject to depict in her pieces because they represented the lasting beauty of the desert and the toughness of the American spirit. It seems like the blue of the sky stands out even more than the skull and the white hollyhock. The hollyhock creates a contrast impossible to ignore. If the skull and the mountains represent the American strength, the white hollyhock may symbolize the fertility of this landscape. Despite feeling terribly miscomprehended before for her flower paintings, O\u2019Keeffe returned continuously to them as subjects.\n \nThe hills were quite a challenge to paint for her; O\u2019Keeffe wrote about this: \u201cI had looked out on the hills for weeks and painted them again and again \u2014had climbed and ridden over them\u2014 so beautifully soft, so difficult. I had painted those hills from the car in bright sunlight and had failed dismally but I could see them\u2014farther away\u2014from my window in the rain. So I tried again,\u201d -  until she conquered them."

Here, Kahlo simultaneously affirms her mixed heritage to confront Nazi ideology, using a format - the genealogical chart - employed by the Nazi party to determine racial purity.

        "description": "This painting was the first that this Liverpool-born artist exhibited in London, where it was shown at the Society of British Artists in 1855 and sold for four guineas. It is an example of the small-scale genre subjects for which Campbell is best known and which portray incidents from respectable lower-middle class and artisan life in Liverpool, often in a humourous vein. The Lollipop was painted and exhibited during the height of the influence of Pre-Raphaelitism in England. Campbell was a member of the Liverpool School, a group of painters within the Liverpool Academy who were particularly receptive to Pre-Raphaelitism and who supported and imitated the London school. William Windus (1822-1907) was the most important member of this group. The Lollipop, a subject from contemporary life, is painted with the detailed execution and bright, clear colour that characterise Campbell's work and which are Pre-Raphaelite traits. In fact, paintings by Campbell have, in the past, been mistakenly attributed to John Everett Millais (1829-1896) and Ford Madox Brown (1821-1893). The use of lighter and less intense colours generally distinguishes works by the Liverpool Pre-Raphaelites from those of their London fellows.\r\nCampbell has been described by Frank Milner as 'the most Dickensian of all the Pre-Raphaelites' (Milner 1995, p.138) and his tale of the poor, blind child, to whom local charity is offered in the form of a lollipop, is a study in minutely observed character and sentiment. Despite her blank expression and large eyes that apparently register nothing, the girl's obediently folded arms, tidy feet, slightly inclined head and open mouth suggest that the treat is precious and eagerly anticipated. The ragged street vendor cocks his head sympathetically on one side to watch as the lollipop is safely delivered. Campbell's restrained use of colour, which is reserved for the bright yellows and pinks of the child's plaid shawl and the yellow and pink sweets upon the tray, sentimentalises the plight of the little blind girl. The red admiral butterfly in Millais's The Blind Girl of 1856 (Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery) produces a similar effect. The sketchier depiction of background details is a characteristic that is noticeable in other paintings by this artist. Marrillier attributed it to the fact that Campbell 'had not the gift of combining figures with scenery'. (H.C. Marrillier, The Liverpool School of Painters, London 1904, p.84)"

The painting is rich in symbolism and iconography, although there is a lack of consensus amongst critics about its meaning. Even the title of the painting may not be original, as it was not recorded until 1693. The composition of the picture contains elements found in the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione]Giorgione[/url], whose style had a significant influence on Titian at the beginning of his career.\n\nThe woman to the left is dressed in wedding attire and may represent carnal love and beauty. In contrast, the nude is usually read as spiritual love, a symbol of simplicity and purity. The position of Eros, at the center of the two, therefore, may indicate the point of mediation between spiritual and sexual desires.\n\nThe coat of arms on the trough belongs to the family of Niccol\u00f2 Aurelio, who later became Grand Chancellor of Venice. In May of 1514, he married Laura Bagarotto, daughter of the jurist Bertuccio Bagarotto who had been executed some months before the wedding on charges of betraying the Serenissima Republic. The painting was probably commissioned to celebrate the marriage. It has been suggested that the relief design on the front of the trough symbolizes life and death, inviting the newlywed Laura, to overcome the sorrow for the loss of her father and flourish in marital love, both spiritual and physical. Alternative readings for this design include symbolism for the taming of passions or hidden literary references."

        "description": "This painting depicts the moment in the [i]Book of Genesis[/i] when God expels Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. Rather than focusing on the naked humanity of the couple, Cole dwarfs them within a natural setting whose scale and majesty symbolize divine power. Counterintuitively, the painting should be read from right to left, since the Garden of Eden was traditionally located in the east: from where fierce shards of light seem to evacuate the couple forcibly. The surrounding landscape is highly allegorical, a visual expression of Pathetic Fallacy, with the bright, cloudless skies of Eden offset against the brooding, stormy skies to the right.\n\nThis relatively early work exemplifies Cole's interest in religious themes, and his desire to equate the unspoiled beauty of the American landscape with the manifestation of God's will. If works such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-cole/lake-with-dead-trees-catskill-1825][i]Lake with Dead Trees[/i][/url] (1825) indicate the Romantic infusion in Cole's painting style, this work shows his affinity with the allegorical, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/neoclassicism]Neoclassical[/url] landscape works of 17th-century European painters such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-lorrain]Claude Lorrain[/url] and Gaspard Dughet. Rather than depicting a version of a natural landscape, in this case, an imaginative landscape based on the American wilds forms the backdrop for a scene from mythical antiquity, each element of which is highly symbolically loaded. The framing and miniaturization of human activity within that larger scene is reminiscent of Neoclassical landscapes such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Nicholas Poussin[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin/landscape-with-a-man-killed-by-a-snake-1648][i]Landscape with a Man Killed by a Snake[/i][/url] (1648).\n\n[i]Expulsion from the Garden of Eden[/i] and similar works were not well-received when they debuted, perhaps because the American public was not yet ready to embrace Cole's apparent departure from the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/romanticism]Romantic[/url] landscape style for which he was already well-known. Some commentators also criticized this painting as being too similar to an engraving produced by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-martin]John Martin[/url] for an edition of Milton's [i]Paradise Lost[/i] (1667). Nonetheless, the painting demonstrates the breadth of Cole's historical influences and was revealing in bringing to the surface the significant religious undercurrent in his work. Cole would return to religious painting towards the end of his life after joining the Episcopal Church."

        "description": "The work day of the nineteenth century French peasant began at 4 am, and during the harvest, could extend well into the evening hours, after the last ringing of the Angelus.  Respite came during midday, where the shade of a haystack was the only shelter from the blazing sun.  It is this moment that has been captured in Lhermitte's exquisite pastel. \n\nLike Jean Fran\u00e7ois Millet, Lhermitte excelled in his handling of the pastel medium, and the virtuosity of his technique is no better expressed than in this 1898 scene of two peasants resting in a golden summer landscape.   Under a blue sky streaked with pink clouds, a male harvester naps on a soft pile of straw; he is either soon to be joined by his standing female companion, or shortly awaken to continue his work in the fields.  Judging from the heavy stacks of hay, it has been a bountiful harvest.  Lhermitte's skill and versatility in his handling of the pastel crayon is perhaps best shown in the rendering of the landscape. Strong, confident sweeps of a yellow chalk convincingly convey the appearance of the long stalks of straw, already bunched, tied and stacked.  In contrast, the mounded haystacks are created by swirling, overlapping strokes.  Most of the ground has been scythed by the harvesters; the small stalks that remain for the gleaners have been drawn in color, in short, choppy, vertical marks of yellow, green, brown and pink chalks.  A more delicate handling of the pastel medium is used to create the golden yellow of the harvested field in the distance. Against this background setting infused with a rich, warm palette, Lhermitte clothes his two harvesters in various cooler shades of blue.\n\nIn 1865, Millet executed a pastel of the same subject, which so appealed to Vincent van Gogh, that he made an almost direct copy.  Van Gogh's admiration of both Millet and Lhermitte is recounted often in his letters:  \"For me that man [Lhermitte] is Millet the Second, in the full sense of the term; I adore his work as much as that of Millet himself.  I think his genius of the same order as that of Millet the First\" (Letter to Anthon van Rappard, August 1885).  Several of Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo in 1885, also mention a series of prints depicting the months of the year (Les Mois Rustiques) that Lhermitte illustrated for the French magazine, Le Monde Illustr\u00e9.  A different peasant theme accompanied each monthly issue, and in anticipation, Van Gogh repeatedly asked Theo to send him the most recent copies.  Van Gogh also commented to Theo that \"the peasants by Lhermitte...are so splendid just because of the life there is in them.\"(Letter to Theo, 4 or 5 May, 1885). This heartfelt tribute remains just as true for us today as we consider, with our own eyes,  Lhermitte's beautiful pastel of harvesters at rest on a hot summer day."

The inscription on the parapet does not help. These letters, VVO, have been interpreted as a form of the Latin vivo (in life). This would suggest that the portrait was painted from life and that it confers on both subject and painter a measure of immortality. It may more likely, however, be an abbreviation of a humanist motto, perhaps virtus vincit omnia (virtue conquers all).\n\nLike other paintings associated with Giorgione, this one presents difficulties of attribution. Both Titian and Sebastiano are know to have completed works that remained unfinished when Giorgione died prematurely in his early thirties. (It was said that Giorgione contracted the plague from his mistress.) A second hand seems to be at work in this painting. The portrait's format, with subject glancing sidelong at the viewer from behind a parapet, was developed by Giorgione, and the soft, shadowy gradations of tone also recall his style. However, its aggressive mood points to a painter with a bolder brush and more active, worldly outlook, like Titian."

He chose a later scene, when St Irene and one of her servants were bathing his wounds; only a broken arrow in the centre foreground and the remains of a rope around his right wrist recall his ordeal. Brilliantly lit by a light source coming from the upper right corner, the saint's body stands out against the shapes of two kneeling women in dark clothing looming out of the darkness and hardly discernible against the nocturnal landscape. The subtle shift from shadow to light is however not what visitors in 1865 would have seen as the industrially produced paints he used have evolved differently and the shadows in particular have turned black."

The viewer's gaze is directed past the menu cards and the vividly painted foods in the window display and the waitress who leans forward to adjust them, into an interior of polished wood, tiled floors, and wall mirrors where a man and woman eat and a cashier attends to business at her register. Hopper painted this large canvas in the studio, working from sketches that he had made of local restaurants. Yet despite the bright lighting and the warm, even garish, colors, this is not a particularly festive scene. The two diners chat between themselves, but the cashier and the waitress are lost in their separate thoughts and duties. As in many of his works, Hopper indirectly comments on the loneliness and weariness that so many city dwellers experience.\r\nDespite Hopper's reluctance to assign historical context to his work, this painting also speaks of several social changes of the era. For example, it represents the new roles that women were occupying in public; both the cashier and the waitress, for example, are women working outside the home. The title also alludes to a recent social innovation, in which dining establishments advertised \"tables for ladies\" in order to welcome their newly mobile female customers. In the past, it had often been assumed that women appearing alone in restaurants or bars were prostitutes in search of business; now, dining on their own or with other women, they would be treated respectfully. In addition, the date of this painting serves as a reminder that Hopper was living in New York during the Great Depression, when many Americans could not afford to dine out, even at such an unpretentious establishment as this one."

In the background, a battle scene suggests that retreat is underway. The officer is a real-life figure, Alexandre Dieudonn\u00e9, who was a friend of the artist. He is depicted twisting backward, sword ready, in a dramatically contorted pose.\n\nMilitary figures were among the artist's favorite themes, with this being one of his earliest and yet most important examples. The work also utilizes another favored subject of the artist, the horse, which he returned to throughout his career. The scene G\u00e9ricault chose to depict is not a moment of military victory, as was commonly represented by the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/neoclassicism]Neoclassical[/url] artists of the period. Everything in the narrative implies that the battle is about to be lost. The officer seems to look back in sad resignation. Instead of an idealized scene created using Ancient Roman or Greek motifs, as was common in the French Neoclassical style, G\u00e9ricault chose to depict a romanticized scene full of drama. The tension is enhanced by bold color choices and varied light effects. His depiction reinforces the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism]Romantic[/url] idea of the hero who, rather than seen triumphing, is shown struggling, brooding, or sad in the face of uncertain fate.\n\nThe choice of the subject could be seen as slightly ironic, given that his father had found a way to get him out of military service. Perhaps the work was an attempt to give visual form to the military drama that G\u00e9ricault so admired but had not yet seen first hand. Whatever the work's motivations, it helped to launch G\u00e9ricault's career and was well-received when it was exhibited at the 1812 Paris Salon."

The Darent valley appeared to Palmer a perfect, neo-Platonic world and he called it the 'Valley of Vision'. In this picture he creates an ideal image of pastoral contentment, unaffected by the outside world. The unseasonal combination of flowering horse-chestnut and huge ripe heads of wheat symbolise fertility and the richness of the soil, and Palmer may have been inspired by Edmund Spenser's lines from the Fa\u00ebrie Queene (1596), Book iii, Canto VI, beginning 'There is continuall spring, and harvest there'. The prominent church spire signifies a divine presence within the landscape. This is emphasised by the gothic arch created by the branches at the top of the composition, which relates closely to Coming from Evening Church (1830). In the background, the characteristic rounded hills of Shoreham and the crescent moon, here shown on its back, were later adopted as motifs by artists of the mid-twentieth century. Inspired by John Milton's poetic evocations, the moon in its various phases became a recurring feature in Palmer's work."

Completed shortly after the end of the Franco-Prussian War, it portrays a peaceful Paris as seen from the Trocadero hill. The Champ-de-Mars, which was previously the site of the bustling 1867 Exposition Universelle, is now barren and brown. The gray sky hints at the tumultuous events of the past five years, including the war and the fall of Napoleon III's Second Empire. Three figures in the foreground, likely Morisot's sisters and niece, are separated from the cityscape by a dark fence, suggesting the exclusion of bourgeois women from everyday life and professional opportunities. Despite this, the ground beneath their feet would be massively redeveloped just six years later for the 1878 Exposition Universelle."

        "description": " The title and the content of the work suggest a sort of self-parody, which makes sense considering the late period in Dali\u2019s life during which the painting created.  Though Dali generally worked in oil, Hitler Masturbating is a watercolor. Given the looser nature of the medium, it was likely executed more quickly than the majority of Dali\u2019s canon.  It also represents a departure from the fabricated automatism of Dali\u2019s meticulous photorealism.  The brushstrokes are looser and the landscape more impressionistic.  The painting depicts exactly what the title suggests; the dictator, in full Nazi uniform, sits in an armchair, his back to the viewer amidst a barren snowscape.  His chair appears to morph into a group of horses, the hooves of which still bear resemblance to the chair.  The image evokes Dali\u2019s 1942 watercolor Sheep, in which a herd of sheep have their hooves inexplicably replaced by gilded furniture legs.  The transformation from chair to horse evokes the journey of the retired soldier, once on horseback, now on plaid.  It could be argued that the painting is an attempt on Dali\u2019s part to humanize Hitler. By depicting him from behind, Dali renders him anonymous, simply a figure engaged in an intensely private yet ubiquitous act.  Given Dali\u2019s sense of humor, however, the painting is more likely a dirty joke on Dali\u2019s part.  As Hitler masturbates, he looks upon a barren wasteland, an emptiness that resembles the destruction of Europe by his own hand."

        "description": "Also called Bathsheba with King David's Letter, this painting depicts Bathsheba nude at her bath while she pensively ponders the King's letter in her right hand. The rich colors, the copper and gold draperies in the background, echoed by the gleaming gold of Bathsheba's jewelry emphasize the luminous glow of her nude body. The use of chiaroscuro seen in the white linen contrasting with the dark background and the highlights of her skin contrasting with the fabric's softly shadowed folds creates a sensual presence. The body here is almost palpable, drawing the viewer's eye. The painting is based upon the Biblical account of how King David, having seen Bathsheba bathing, commanded her to come to his palace, even though she was married to one of his generals, Uriah. When she obeyed and became pregnant as a result, David had her husband sent into the front lines of battle to be killed so that he could marry her. Subsequently, their child was stillborn, and David, realizing his sinfulness, did penance sitting in rags and ashes at the city's gate for a year. For the religious viewers of the time, the familiar Biblical story would have added a sense of fateful foreshadowing to the moment depicted here, as if Bathsheba were pondering not only her moral and personal dilemma, but also what would follow. The maidservant, kneeling at left to wash her foot, has her gaze discreetly lowered in darkness, as if aware of what the letter means.\n\nGoing against the current of his time, Rembrandt was the only great artist of the nude in the Dutch Golden Age, though he transfigured the genre by, as Simon Schama noted, creating \"the first depiction of a woman thinking.\" The model for this painting is thought to be Hendrickje Stoffels, Rembrandt's life companion, though that attribution continues to be debated. Nonetheless, the work conveys intimacy of presence and of thought.\n\nThis work influenced Manet's The Surprised Nymph (1859-1861), Degas' Women Having Her Hair Combed (c. 1885), Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille's La Toilette (1870), and Picasso's Seated Nude and Another Figure (1963). Picasso was particularly influenced by Rembrandt, whom he took for a kind of alter ego, saying \"every painter takes himself for Rembrandt.\""

        "description": "Catalogue Note\nDescribed by the painter Jacques-Louis David as 'l'homme du si\u00e8cle', Napoleon was without question the dominant political and military figure in Europe in the early 19th century, and for over a decade held the destiny of the continent in his grasp. This magnificent image of the Emperor is a fascinating reflection of that same period; not only because it is a potent statement of the aura of the great general by one of the supreme exponents of military painting of his day, but also because, due to its remarkable history, it provides an equally fascinating testament to the cult of the Emperor that was to rise so quickly in England in the years immediately following his defeat at the hands of Wellington and the Allied Armies at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\n\nAlthough Vernet painted a large number of scenes from the Emperor's life and in particular of his military exploits, he was not considered a portrait painter. Indeed in size and grandeur of conception the present painting would appear to be unique. Vernet's only biographer, Armand Dayot, lists no paintings in his early biography (Carle Vernet - \u00c9tude sur l'artiste, Paris 1925), but does record a large and highly finished drawing of reasonably similar design showing Napoleon on horseback as 'Protector of the Rhine Federation and King of Italy', which can be dated to 1807, when a reproductive engraving of it was made (op. cit., no. 21). Despite this, it is difficult to date the present work exactly. Another version of the picture, which is widely believed to have been given by Napolean to General Anne Jean Marie Ren\u00e9 Savary, Duke of Rovigo (1774-1833), has a suggested dating between 1805 and 1810. That work, a signed example, is the probable prime composition, however a similar dating for this canvas would not seem unreasonable. The painting itself offers no clues: the background engagement is of a very generalised type, and although the heroic figure of the Emperor is much influenced by that in Vernet's great painting of the battle of Marengo of 1808, it would seem that no specific engagement can here be identified. Napoleon is shown wearing the badge and sash of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur, which he himself established on the 19 May 1802. The legend that the grey horse depicted in the painting is Napoeon's favourite mount 'Marengo' is apocryphal, as the Emperor habitually rode small grey arabians."

The painting shows a key point in Gibraltar's history when the Great Siege of Gibraltar was undertaken by the Spanish against the British at Gibraltar in November 1781. The Spanish officer Don Jose de Barboza is being given respect as he lies dying. Although left behind by his own retreating troops he still unsuccessfully attacked the British troops with chivalry.\r\n\r\nThe painting is based on a real attack that took place in Gibraltar on November 27, 1781. The Great Siege of Gibraltar was an unsuccessful attempt by Spain and France to capture Gibraltar from the British during the War of American Independence.\r\n\r\nThe painting depicts the events of the night of November 26, 1781 when British troops made a sudden attack (sortie), against the enemy batteries. The death of the Spanish officer Don Jose de Barboza is the focal point of the painting. He fell mortally wounded and died near his post refusing assistance after having been abandoned by his troops. He is portrayed as rejecting the aid of General George Elliott, commander of the British troops.\r\n\r\nIn 1782, the Siege was lifted and Trumbull's friend Antonio de Poggi, an artist and dealer based in London who had been in the besieged garrison, told him of an earlier incident, which had occurred in November 1781. This had all the ingredients he sought: \u201c...the Heroism of the vanquished, the Humanity of the Victors - the darkness of night illuminating an extensive conflagration - the Hurry and Tumult of the troops busy in the work of destruction - the quiet & calm of the Officers, the guiding Spirits of the Scene.\u201d\r\n\r\nTrumbull labored on the composition, over many sketches and three large completed canvases. As the project progressed, Trumbull's ambitions for it to be his big breakthrough to major patronage grew too. He refused large offers for the picture, preferring to exhibit it privately for admission fees.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford had called the painting: \u201cthe finest picture [I] had ever seen painted on the northern side of the Alps.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe painting is depicted on the back of the 2010 Gibraltar 10-pound note."

It is one of the few mythological pictures by Bellini, who completed it in 1514. After his death soon afterwards (1516), Titian probably modified the landscape on the left to match it to his The Bacchanal of the Andrians (1518\u20131523), also in Alfonso's camerino. A more thorough reworking in about 1529 added more landscape, adding the mountain behind the figures.\r\n\r\nThe scene depicted conflates two episodes in Ovid's Fasti. Priapus, on the right, is attempting to seduce the sleeping nymph Lotis, but is prevented from success by the bray of Silenus' donkey. Around are the drunken Gods: Jupiter has an eagle next to him, Poseidon is caressing Cybele and Ceres, while Hermes is languidly lying on a barrel. The boy with vine-leaves on his head is an unusually young depiction of Bacchus. It is thought that Bellini initially painted the figures as mortals, following a misleading translation of Ovid (the so-called Ovidio volgarizzato), and had to re-paint them with the attributes of the Olympian gods."

Although Rothko never purposefully created a series of subway paintings, this was a recurring theme in his early works. Rothko moved to New York in 1923 after giving up his studies at Yale University. In New York, he attended classes at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/art-students-league#!#resultType:masonry]Art Students League[/url]. Several years later, Rothko met the modernist painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/milton-avery]Milton Avery[/url], who had a profound impact on his early artistic development, particularly on the application and treatment of color. Additionally, the slightly elongated figures in [i]Entrance to the Subway[/i] are reminiscent of Avery\u2019s figures in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/milton-avery/artist-s-wife-1930][i]Artist\u2019s Wife[/i][/url] (1930).\n\n[i]Entrance to the Subway[/i], along with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/untitled-subway-1937][i]Untitled (Subway)[/i][/url] (ca.1937) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/underground-fantasy][i]Underground Fantasy[/i][/url] (1940), shows the alienation of city life. It is similar to the atmosphere [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-hopper]Edward Hopper[/url] projected in paintings [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-hopper/automat-1927][i]Automat[/i][/url] (1927) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-hopper/chop-suey-1929][i]Chop Suey[/i][/url] (1929) that expressed the same kind of urban loneliness and isolation. Rothko admired Hopper and even painted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/composition-i-1931][i]Composition I[/i][/url] (1931) as an homage to Hopper. \n\nThough paintings like [i]Entrance to the Subway[/i] are related to Depression-era realist paintings, the similarity mainly stems from the common subject matter of urban life. Generally, Rothko rejected the principles of realist painting, whether it was [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/social-realism]Social Realism[/url] or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/regionalism]American Regionalism[/url]. In fact, in 1935, Rothko co-founded the art group [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/the-ten]The Ten[/url], whose members included artists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/willem-de-kooning]Willem de Kooning[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-baziotes]William Baziotes[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/adolph-gottlieb]Adolph Gottlieb[/url]. In 1938, the group held an exhibition called [i]The Ten Whitney Dissenters[/i], vocalizing their dissatisfaction with the Whitney Museum of American Art. The artists condemned the Museum policy of supporting realist styles. Thus, Rothko and his colleagues positioned themselves as revolutionary outcasts, showing disdain for the art establishment as well as for the socialist realist left orthodoxy.\n\nIn this period, Rothko chose to paint in an expressionist style, which suited his artistic approach. He was not interested in the realism of city life; rather, he wanted to express the emotional perception of the urban environment. [i]Entrance to the Subway[/i] has a dark and haunting atmosphere. While the viewer can recognize the human figures as commuters and subway workers, for the most part, they remain faceless, emphasizing the feeling of isolation and alienation. In the monotonous routine of daily life, the individual can only identify people superficially but cannot make a meaningful or lasting connection.\nEven though stylistically [i]Entrance to the Subway[/i] is very different from the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/color-field-painting#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]color-field[/url] paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/cat-newyork][i]Yellow, Charcoal, Brown[/i][/url] (1953) Rothko is known for, this early work hints at his future artistic development. In [i]Entrance to the Subway[/i], Rothko demonstrated sophisticated use of color that will later become a focal point in his work."

Her pose recalls the figure of prophet Isaiah from Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling, but Mrs Siddons insisted she had composed it spontaneously herself. This is one of three versions Reynolds made of the portrait."

Reynolds is surrounded by his books and papers, and a bust of Michelangelo stands to the far left, symbolizing the inspiration that passes between artists. The vivid colors and Reynolds' seventeenth-century clothing evoke the portraits of Anthony van Dyck, the Flemish artist whom Kauffman was hailed to succeed upon her arrival in London. However, unlike van Dyck's formal style, Kauffman's portrait captures a personal glimpse into the life of her subject, revealing a touching sentimentality that became a defining feature of her portraiture.\n\nKauffman's ability to render her subjects humble and human was evident in her other portraits as well, such as the actor David Garrick and the German archaeologist and antiquarian Winckelmann. Throughout her time in England, Reynolds remained an important friend and contact for Kauffman. He introduced her to potential clients and helped her to maintain her reputation after the scandal of her first marriage. The intimacy and trust between the two artists are evident in Reynolds' expression in the portrait."

As in the first Hispanic Room mural, he moved from a distant general view to a specific close-up incident. In both paintings there is violent excitement; both represent the tenseness of the moment of discovery; both are exultant. But here the painter introduces a more frenzied pattern through the symbol of the worker's hand, raised, gesticulating, grasping, pressing. Impressionistic in color in the sudden brilliant strokes of unrelated colors on the skiff, in the hair of the miners, in the glint of gold and the tiny gleaming fish, this painting marks the farthest evolution of the painter's mural style toward the dissolution of form and color and derives from a series of experimental oils centering around the theme of a shipwreck, which Portinari made in the summer of 1941."

        "description": "The painting is the first of a series of works that Tintoretto painted in 1548 for the Scuola Grande di San Marco while Marco Episcopi, artist's future father-in-law, was Grand Guardian of the School.\n\nThe subject of the huge canvas is the miraculous appearance of St Mark to rescue one of his devotees, a servant of a knight of Provence, who had been condemned to having his legs broken and his eyes put out for worshipping the relics of St Mark against his master's will. The scene takes place on a kind of proscenium which seems to force the action out of the painting towards the spectator who is thus involved in the amazement of the crowd standing in a semi-circle around the protagonists: the fore-shortened figure of the slave lying on the ground, the dumbfounded executioner holding aloft the broken implements of torture, the knight of Provence starting up from his seat out of the shadow into the light. In contrast, the figure of St Mark swoops down from above.\n\nThe overall composition of [i]The Miracle of the Slave[/i], although set within an opulent Roman courtyard, is intense with action. Three times the executioner attempted to levy the punishment, and each time the tools have broken before the slave could be harmed. This is the work of Saint Mark, who, in dramatic fashion, descends from heaven in a red robe and billowing orange cape to rescue the slave and spare him the suffering associated with this painful death. This miracle also converts the slave's master at embracing the Christian faith.\n\nThe great influence that [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo]Michelangelo[/url] had on Tintoretto's artistic style is visible in this work; the robust, muscular figures staged in a variety of complex positions are reminiscent of the Renaissance master. Scholars doubt whether Tintoretto made studies from the sculptural maquettes or other works based on the originals by Michelangelo.\n\nDespite some of the initial criticism Tintoretto received for the speed at which he worked, made evident from the loose and gestural brushwork, this painting had a profound impact on Tintoretto's career. A commission for the Confraternity of Scuola Grande di San Marco brought the artist wide attention, after which he began receiving many commissions. According to Tintoretto's biographers, some members of the confraternity argued against accepting it, enraging the artist, who took it back to his studio. But eventually, the naysayers were discomfited, Tintoretto and his proponents won the day, and the painting was installed to great acclaim. The acceptance of this work was an essential step towards broadening the stylistic range of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/venetian-school]Venetian School[/url]. In addition to the more traditional approaches of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url], here, Tintoretto provided a highly dramatic presentation of a religious subject, which helped to lay the foundation for the future development of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] art."

He takes the sinuous forms of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/art-nouveau-modern]Art Nouveau[/url] (a decorative style he had used as a commercial artist and in images such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/northern-river-1915][i]Northern River[/i][/url], 1915), and the brash and vivid colors of the early [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/expressionism]Expressionists[/url] (especially in the ribbons of red in the foreground, outlining boulder-shaped areas), and uses them to create his composition. The image, based on a landscape he knew well, contains imaginary elements too.\n\nThomson places the pine tree alone on a point beside a lake. It stands in the middle of the canvas, lopped off at the top\u2014a position that transforms a simple subject into one making a strong and provocative statement. The twisted trunk and branches show age and perseverance, and bravery against the elements. The painting may also reflect Thomson\u2019s state of mind\u2014a mental or metaphorical self-portrait. He may have felt empathy with the tree, for the way it had grown and survived. He painted this canvas while, in Europe, the First World War was raging\u2014a cataclysmic event in which many of his friends were involved. Survival, threatening circumstances, and the possibility of great loss had become paramount issues for everyone around him.\n \nThe background of the painting is a complicated invention of the animated sky, scudding clouds, and wind-driven whitecaps, which together reinforce the painting\u2019s (posthumous) title. Between sky and lake lie the thin wedge of shore and far hills, at once separating yet fusing air and water with pitch-dark vertical stitches of pigment in Prussian green and blue. What impresses viewers most about this painting is its power and energy. The surging sky and the constant movement on the lake\u2019s surface limit the only stillness in the picture: the pine tree itself. Of the entire Canadian canon, this painting is closest in its intensity to the paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent van Gogh[/url].\n\nThe completed canvas is very different, both as an idea and in its detail, from the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/sketch-for-the-west-wind-1916]sketch[/url] Thomson made in the spring of 1916. Whereas most of Thomson\u2019s small oil sketches were markedly fresher, stronger, and more intimate than the canvases derived from them, this painting surpasses the sketch with its dynamism. No other canvases by Thomson, with the exceptions of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/the-jack-pine-1917][i]The Jack Pine[/i][/url] 1917 (sketched and painted in the same time frame as [i]The West Wind[/i]), and of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/opulent-october-1916][i]Opulent October[/i][/url] 1916 (painted the winter before from a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/sketch-for-opulent-october-1915]sketch[/url] done in the summer of 1915), share this same superb quality.\n \nMore often, the canvases fail to attain the level of intensity and immediacy that an artist experiences when the moment of inspiration strikes and the subject is at hand. The working-up of several other canvases done at this time, 1916\u20131917, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/woodland-waterfall-1916][i]Woodland Waterfall[/i][/url] 1916 (not a successful painting), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/the-fisherman-1917][i]The Fisherman[/i][/url] 1917, and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-thomson/the-drive-1917][i]The Drive[/i][/url] 1917, are all examples of paintings with the stagey quality and stiff awkwardness that led Dr. James MacCallum (a friend and patron of Thomson) to claim they were unfinished. They have neither the confidence nor the magisterial aplomb of [i]The West Wind[/i] or [i]The Jack Pine[/i]."

The subject's attention is drawn to two sailboats on the right side of the high horizon line. The bearded man on the shore is Gustave Courbet, a Realist painter who was Whistler's friend and who accompanied him to Trouville in 1865. Originally called Courbet - on Sea Shore, the title was later changed by Whistler to reflect his growing interest in connecting his paintings to musical compositions. The figure and the landscape are almost indistinguishable, blending seamlessly into the washes of color created by Whistler's sweeping brushstrokes of thinned paint.\n\nThe painting pays tribute to Courbet, who greatly influenced Whistler's early artistic development, while also signaling Whistler's departure from Courbet's realism in favor of Aestheticism. Trouville does not have a clear message or moral lesson. Instead, it showcases Whistler's exploration of color tones and paint application methods to evoke visual or sensory stimulation. This idea that color harmony, mood, and form beauty are more crucial than subject matter was at the heart of \"art for art's sake,\" the proud motto of the Aesthetic movement, of which Whistler became a leading advocate. The soft colors and dreamy, atmospheric quality of the painting, produced through Whistler's broad, sweeping brushstrokes, also positions it as an important predecessor to the American Tonalist movement of the 1880s."

Though she looks back at the viewer with a friendly and curious gaze, she maintains an air of propriety. In his later years, Bouguereau painted numerous rustic genre scenes that appealed greatly to collectors, particularly those depicting young girls in pastoral settings. His sentimentalized portrayal of peasant life, which differed from the more realistic approach of artists like Courbet and Millet, nonetheless showcased his technical mastery of naturalistic figure painting.\n\nAlthough Bouguereau's depictions of the peasantry have been criticized as pandering to market tastes, some art historians argue that he also celebrated their nobility and humility. While his genre scenes often idealize peasant women, treating them as if they were Raphael Madonnas, he also imbued certain individuals with unique personalities that complicated his general commercializing approach. However, Bouguereau never took a strong moral or sociological stance on the underclass like his contemporaries did, and his political views tended to lean towards conservatism when expressed. The Young Shepherdess, in particular, was based on one of the Italian immigrant girls whom Bouguereau employed as models during family vacations in La Rochelle. These girls received a monthly salary, performed household chores, and shared meals with his family."

        "description": "One of the most iconic and recognizable paintings in the world is the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] (ca. 1503-1519) painted by Leonardo da Vinci. The unique appeal of the portrait lies in its enigmatic nature, Mona Lisa\u2019s smile radiates mystery, sensuality and contentment. This was achieved through sfumato, Leonardo\u2019s painting technique that softened the transition between colors. This depth and complexity of expression is the reason the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] is regarded as the pinnacle of portraiture. The interest in the portrait was further amplified by its mysterious history: the identity of the sitter, who commissioned the painting, how long Leonardo worked on the portrait and how it entered the French royal collection are all topics of scholarly debate. \n\nIt is thought that the sitter was Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo. For this reason, the painting is sometimes called [i]La Gioconda[/i]. The earliest identification of the painting was provided by the Renaissance art historian [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari]Giorgio Vasari[/url]. In Vasari\u2019s 1550 biography of Leonardo, he wrote about the magnificent portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, which Leonardo worked on between 1503 and 1506. Many were skeptical of Vasari\u2019s account; however, a 2005 discovery at the University of Heidelberg provided compelling new evidence that confirms Vasari\u2019s assertion. In a volume written by the ancient philosopher Cicero from 1477, there was a handwritten marginal by Leonardo\u2019s contemporary, the secretary and assistant to Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Agostino Vespucci. In the note dated October 1503, Vespucci praises Leonardo\u2019s skill by comparing him to the Greek and painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url], and states that Leonardo is working on a portrait of Lisa del Giacondo.\n\nThe [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was the earliest example in Italian portraiture that portrayed the sitter in a half-length format. Leonardo presented a new artistic formula: the figure is shown at half-length sitting in armchair in front of a [i]loggia[/i] - a gallery or room with one or more open sides. The incorporation of the [i]loggia[/i] allowed Leonardo to present an imaginary landscape as the backdrop of the portrait. This significant innovation influenced Leonardo contemporaries: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] adopted the composition and pose in his portrait [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portrait-of-a-lady-with-a-unicorn-1506][i]Young Woman with Unicorn[/i][/url] (ca. 1506). Still it is important to note that Leonardo was indebted to Flemish portraiture of the second half of the 15th century, particularly the portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling]Hans Memling[/url] such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/barbara-de-vlaenderberch-1475][i]Portrait of Barbara van Vlaendenbergh[/i][/url] (ca. 1470-1472) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/portrait-of-a-man-holding-a-coin-of-the-emperor-nero-1474][i]Man with a Roman coin[/i][/url] (ca. 1480).\n\nLeonardo spent his final years in France, where his patron the King of France, Francis I, purchased [i]Mona Lisa[/i] for the royal French collection. From 1797, the portrait is on permanent display at the Louvre and is the crown jewel of the museum collection. On the morning of August 22 1911, Louvre employees were shocked to discover that the painting was stolen the previous night. Two years later, Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia was identified as the thief. Peruggia claimed his motives were patriotic: he believed Leonardo\u2019s masterpiece belonged in Italy and was caught trying to sell the painting in Florence. After its discovery, the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was exhibited throughout Italy before its celebratory return to the Louvre in 1914."

        "description": "By the end of the 90s, Currin's controversial approach was gradually becoming accepted within artistic circles. Marrying his wife and muse, the artist Rachel Feinstein in 1997, he swiftly gave up the anxious, frustrated and 'burdened' women of his early oeuvre. Amorous depictions of his wife proliferate through the artist's recent body of work, asserting a new focus on idealised beauty and grace. In The Pillow, Currin's woman has a serene elegance, looking with affection at someone of something in the distance. She replaces Currin's earlier female caricatures with a sumptuous and sensual depiction of a woman. \n\nCreated upon a rich golden-brown ground, the artist illuminates the composition through the slow and smooth process of layering lighter hues of coloured paint. It is a skillful simulation of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci]Leonardo da Vinci[/url]'s signature technique, sfumato that fosters subtle shade and gentle gradations of tone. Traces of the painting's dark base layers abound in the lustrous lapis silk cushion, the delicate bustier of her dress, the warmth of her eyes, in the body of her ochre hair. It is a skillful composition that beautifully captures the mood and atmosphere of the artist's sitter. It is a painting that departs from the artist's early sensational, and politically activated depictions of sexualized womanhood, speaking instead to the elegance and fine detail of 16th century [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/mannerism-late-renaissance]Mannerism[/url].

        "description": "Arguably Reynolds' most famous fancy picture, this work belongs to a genre he started painting in the 1770s featuring young children, often dressed in exotic costumes and situated in fantastical locations. The painting aims to elicit pity in the viewer; curator Lucy Davis notes how \"the young figure's large, deep-set eyes stare intensely at the viewer, and her timid, hunched posture creates a pathetic effect.\" Reynolds often used poor children as models, which could lend authenticity to the sad life that this young sitter presumably lived, although her identity remains unknown.\n\nWhile strawberry sellers were a common sight in 18th century London, they were typically young women rather than children. Reynolds employs dramatic license in the painting by removing the figure from an urban setting, placing her in front of a looming rocky outcrop, and inventing an exotic costume. These details contribute to a slightly surreal and unsettling quality in the work. Additionally, the pale color palette of the painting, although due to fading, heightens its sense of the uncanny. Reynolds experimented with new paints and pigments, which has caused fading, blistering, and cracking in some of his works.\n\nReynolds greatly enjoyed painting fancy pictures, as documented by his biographers. James Northcote, who worked as his assistant, noted that Reynolds would spend days and weeks working on his fancy subjects, often at the expense of his unfinished portraits. Northcote stated, \"such was his delight in working on those fancy subjects that he was content to indulge it even at the expense of his immediate interest.\""

This painting includes a forest in the background, which was one of the painting types first produced and displayed by Rousseau, foreshadowing his complex jungle scenes. Critics were initially baffled at the images of the people, who in many cases were strangely costumed, and somehow located in the middle of a large and foreboding forest.

There she had lessons with the Czech painter Frantisek Foltyn (1891 - 1976) and met artists and poets, including Andr\u00e9 Breton (1896-1966) and Paul Eluard (1895-1952), who were already champions of Surrealism.\r\n\r\nAgar was aware that her work needed a new direction and it was in this work that she began to move towards a more dedicated surrealist style. In this painting she combined three concepts, each represented by architecture. She explained,\r\n\r\n\"In it, a pillar stands for Greek culture, Notre Dame is a symbol of Christianity, and a bridge built by Eiffel (the Tower man) symbolises modern technology reaching into the future and expressing time to come. It was my first attempt at an imaginative approach to painting, and although the result was in some ways surreal, it was not done with that intention. However, Surrealism was in the air, for painters and poets in France, and later in England, were kissing that sleeping beauty troubled by nightmares; and it was the kiss of life that they gave.\" (Agar, p.93)\r\n\r\nThe painting was first exhibited in 1964 at a retrospective exhibition entitled 'Paintings and Collages 1930-1964' at the Brook Street Gallery with the title Flying Pillar. Agar, however, claimed later that year that she preferred the original title, Three Symbols, which refers to all three elements (conversation of 21 December 1964). (Chloe Johnson)"

        "description": "Cliff Dwellers was exhibited in the 1913 Armory Show, which Bellows helped organize. The painter captures the colorful crowd on New York City\u2019s Lower East Side. It appears to be a hot summer day. People spill out of tenement buildings onto the streets, stoops, and fire escapes. Laundry flaps overhead and a street vendor hawks his goods from his pushcart in the midst of all the traffic. In the background, a trolley car heads toward Vesey Street. Shadowing is evident throughout this painting as make out the distance of each building based on the light and dark shade of each one. This also helps make the crowd seem deeper than we can actually see. The perception of such a large crowd contrasts with the immediate foreground, which leads our eye specifically to the subjects in this area and therefore displaying their significance to this painting. Looking further into the composition of Cliff Dwellers specifically in the system of colors used, The Paintings of George Bellows\u201d, a commentary on most of Bellows\u2019 work, states that: \u201cBellows continued to use Maratta\u2019s system to select the palettes of the paintings through 1913\u2026 Cliff Dwellers, painted in May 1913, was the exception, representing his most complex exploration of the Maratta color system.\u201d The significance of Bellows\u2019 willingness to stray away from his usual system of color and choose a more monochromatic scale of colors, shows the audience how unique this piece of art is and how it differs from all other works not only in subject or theme but also in color.\r\n\r\nThe painting, made in 1913, suggests the new face of New York. Between 1870 and 1915, the city\u2019s population grew from one-and-a-half to five million, largely due to immigration. Many of the new arrivals\u2014Italian, Jewish, Irish, and Chinese\u2014crowded into tenement houses on the Lower East Side\u2014the area north of the Brooklyn Bridge, south of Houston Street, and east of the Bowery. Among them were thousands of Eastern European Jews, who found temporary or permanent shelter along streets such as East Broadway, the setting for Cliff Dwellers. The city had never seen this kind of density before. Within the context of Cliff Dwellers the audience is able to convey a sense of congestion, overpopulation and (primarily seen in the foreground) the impact of the city among the youth. Within the book, The Paintings of George Bellows a historical account of how adamant \u201curban reformers\u201d were during the early twentieth century as thousands of immigrants migrated to neighborhoods of New York. \u201cThe children in Bellows\u2019s Cliff Dwellers, innocent as they appear, exhibited no effects of the requisite \u201cAmericanizing\u201d process urban reformers considered crucial to the maintenance of social order.\u201d Paired with the scrutiny heaped upon immigrants was the fact that they were made to live in conditions, which were made unbearable by the toll of industrialization within these areas. Small and dense were the living quarters of many who worked in similar environments in factories. Small, dense, dark, which can easily be seen within the painting and helps promote the idea of how industrialization has impacted the working class lifestyle. New York Realists were called by critics as the \"revolutionary black gang\" and the \"apostles of ugliness.\" A critic, referring to their depictions also conferred them the pejorative label Ashcan School which became the standard term for this first important American art movement of the 20th century."

The soft lines of the face are combined with cold colors, which suggest a nocturnal image: the color combination of the image would have been attenuated if it hadn't been for the scarlet lips, the redness of the cheeks, the reflections on the hand. The pink color creates a feeling of freshness and youth.\n\nWe can easily trace the remarkable influence of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin]Gauguin[/url] here.

        "description": "[i]The Sower[/i] is Millet's most famous theme and one he repeated several times between 1850 and 1870. For Millet, the subject expressed profound personal and religious beliefs. However, his first version (now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) aroused a storm of controversy when it appeared in the 1850 Paris Salon. Viewers were shocked by Millet's heroic treatment of a lowly peasant at a time when the situation of the French rural poor was degrading, and socialism threatened bourgeois society. The latter version of this painting is now in the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; and lithographic version is in the MET, NY. \n\nMillet was the artist that van Gogh most revered. Although he never saw Millet\u2019s famous [i]Sower[/i] - already in a Boston collection before he was born - van Gogh admired Millet\u2019s other treatments of the theme, and sought to emulate them."

Together with the Ptolemy Cameo, which was stolen in 1574, these three major ancient gems constituted a major focus of attention on the front of the shrine. It is possible that they were a reference to the skulls of the three Magi that were visible when the trapezoidal panel was removed. The theme of Agrippina\u2019s coronation of Nero (she can be seen holding a laurel wreath over his head) may have been re-interpreted in the context of the medieval interpretation that biblical kings were the predecessors of German rulers."

Adele Bloch-Bauer was the only person to be painted twice by Klimt. This painting is perhaps most famous not for its artistic quality, but because of its scandalous history since inception. Upon her death, Adele Bloch-Bauer wished the painting to be given to the Austrian State Gallery, but it was seized by advancing German forces in World War II. In 1945, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer designated the paintings to be the property of his nephew and nieces, including Maria Altmann. Nonetheless, the Austrian government retained ownership of the painting, and was not returned to the Altmann family until 2006 after a long court battle. The painting was then sold at auction for $135 million dollars, which at that time was the highest price paid at auction for a painting. It is now displayed the Neue Art Gallery in New York. "

At that time, the opera was still housed in the rue Le Peletier and had not yet moved to the building designed by Garnier which was soon to replace it. From the 1870s until his death, Degas's favourite subjects were ballerinas at work, in rehearsal or at rest, and he tirelessly explored the theme with many variations in posture and gesture.\r\nMore than the stage performance and the limelight, it was the training and rehearsals that interested him. Here the class is coming to an end \u2013 the pupils are exhausted, they are stretching, twisting to scratch their backs, adjusting their hair or clothes, an earring, or a ribbon, paying little heed to the inflexible teacher, a portrait of Jules Perrot, a real-life ballet master.\r\n\r\nDegas closely observed the most spontaneous, natural, ordinary gestures, the pauses when concentration is relaxed and the body slumps after the exhausting effort of practising and the implacable rigour of the class.\r\n\r\nThe slightly raised viewpoint looking diagonally across the studio accentuates the vanishing perspective of floor boards. Paul Val\u00e9ry wrote: \"Degas is one of the very few painters who gave the ground its true importance. He has some admirable floors\". This is all the more appropriate for dancers in that the parquet, which was moistened to prevent slipping, is their main work tool. And the ballet master beats time on the floor with his baton."

The folds of the fabric, the chrome details so directly exemplary of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/art-deco]Art Deco[/url]-style details, and the striking lighting provide the impression of speed as if the painting captures a fleeting moment. In its issue of October 3rd, 1928, the very widely read weekly [i]Vu[/i] published a cover picture by Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e8sz, featuring a young lady at the wheel of a sports car. The picture caption specified that the model's sports outfit, her gloves, and her leather cap, were all from Herm\u00e8s. Lempicka wears exactly the same accessories in her self-portrait, which was obviously inspired by the Kert\u00e8sz photo.\n\nThe work offers a new image of a modern woman - of unabashed self-determination and unapologetic sexuality. The artist's expression is controlled and dispassionate as she gazes directly at the viewer, appropriating the traditional male gaze and contradicting traditional depictions of women who are meant to be viewed exclusively by male viewers as sex objects.\n\nThe painting was commissioned for the front cover of [i]Die Dame[/i], a German magazine devoted to promoting the concept of the modern woman. This work exemplifies how Lempicka's work occupied a kind of liminal niche between fine art, portraiture to be specific, and graphic art. Unlike her male colleagues whose [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cubism]Cubism[/url]-inspired work included portraits and genre images, Lempicka's work, even in her day, was often considered within the context of the decorative arts."

But he transforms the theme profoundly, stripping the muses of the traditional attributes which allow them to be identified.\r\n\r\nIn the group of three women sitting in the foreground we can see the figure of Marthe, whom the painter married in June 1893 and who inspired his art until her death. In a device common in Denis' work, she is shown twice: in profile in red and from the back, sitting on the chair. Maurice Denis has set the scene on the terrace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the town where he lived all his life. The century-old chestnut trees give the composition rhythm and decorative power. The regular strokes of the tree trunks are a pretext for a play of vertical lines which contrast with the curves and ornamental arabesques of the branches, the leaves strewn on the ground, and the patterns and folds of the dresses. The graphic play of lines and interlacing is intensified by the unreal, autumnal colours, painted in areas of flat colour and neatly outlined. The flattened space is that of a \"sacred wood\", the setting for a revelation and the figures' mysterious communication with nature and supernatural powers. An enigmatic tenth muse in the background (while traditionally there are only nine), with one arm raised to the light of the sky, convinces us of that."

Immensely beautiful with a strong personality, she worked in a cabaret in Montparnasse where she rubbed shoulders with the artistic avant-garde scene. Perhaps this is where she met Paul Guillaume, the dynamic up and coming art dealer? Madly in love with her, he married her in 1920, nicknamed her Domenica and introduced her to Parisian high society. Marie Laurencin was one of the artists associated with Paul Guillaume and at the time was beginning her career in portrait painting. It is therefore not surprising that Domenica wanted her portrait painted, a symbol of renown and wealth.\nMarie Laurencin portrayed her seated, pensive and leaning slightly to one side. Her demeanour, her dress and her pink scarf echo the curtain on the right of the painting. Marie Laurencin included her favourite motifs in the canvas: a large grey dog that resembles a doe, its paws crossed, and a bouquet from which Domenica has picked a flower. The resemblance has been accentuated by the artist, who usually only painted similar and stylised faces. The head of brown hair, the marked line of the eyebrows above the large bright eyes and the shape of the face all indeed belong to Domenica.\n\n[url href=https://www.musee-orangerie.fr/en/artworks/portrait-de-madame-paul-guillaume-196421]Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie[/url]"

But The Oyster Eater was certainly too bold for the highly conservative milieu at the time, and was rejected at the 1882 Salon in Antwerp.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ensor was not entirely without success in traditional circles as he exhibited a painting at the Brussels Salon in 1881 and two others in Paris in 1882. He then committed himself to the liberalisation of art exhibitions, and fought to become the leader of an artistic school. He was particularly involved in creating the group known as Les XX who quickly came to play a leading role in the avant-garde. \r\n\r\nBrought up on the shores of the North Sea, Ensor was passionate about the effects of light. In (...) The Oyster Eater, the shimmering liquids in the glasses and the reflections in the mirror already reveal the painter's interest in the power and quality of light. For him it is the opposite of line, which is in itself the \"enemy of genius\" and \"cannot express passion, anxiety, struggle, pain, enthusiasm or poetry, such beautiful and great feelings\u2026\" (from Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay exhibition text)"

        "description": "Joshua Reynolds developed a daring pose to depict Lady Jane Tollemache, the youngest daughter of the 4th Earl of Dysart and Lady Grace Carteret. Jane is positioned off-centre, as if she is walking out of the frame, emphasising the movement of the wind, hair and drapery. These details were much criticised when the portrait was shown at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1779.\r\n\r\nJane's first husband was John Delap Halliday of Leasowes, Shropshire, whom she married on 23 October 1771. He was the son of a rich Scottish planter in the Caribbean and was a major in the army. It has been suggested that the background is a composite of the landscape around the Leasowes estate in Shropshire, also known for its high winds, but Reynolds may have simply used the device to add drama to his composition.\r\nThe composition may be a flamboyant reworking of an earlier portrait, 'Mrs Hale as \"Euphosyne\"' (Harewood House) that was loosely based on a print of Raphael's 'St Margaret'. The dramatic pose does make this portrait close to Reynolds's subject paintings which depict characters from history or mythology. A good example is Reynolds's 'Thais' which Ferdinand de Rothschild also bought from the Tollemache family.\r\nReynolds's innovations were not always appreciated by his contemporaries. When the painting was displayed in public at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1779, one critic wrote: 'No 250 is a lady in a storm, her hair blows one way, and her neck ornaments the contrary, and the neck swells out too much on the left side'. Another wrote 'We do not know why this lady should choose to be drawn in a high wind, as it does not discover anything formed by the Graces'. The reference to 'Graces' refers to Jane's mother Grace Carteret, and probably to her other two sisters Louisa and Frances.\r\nThe longevity of the critics' opinion is perhaps measured in a later print of around 1810 by the satirist James Gillray. This print shows three ladies attempting to keep their skirts from being blown up, with the caption: 'The graces in a high wind'. One pose in particular may have been loosely based on Reynolds's portrait of Jane, known through a mezzotint published in 1779."

The painter's reflections on contemporary history allowed him to move from depicting episodes of struggle for the claim of elementary rights of the people and workers to the affirmation of a slow but inexorable progress of the entire working class, which has risen to be the protagonist of the new century. The painting - as well as those that preceded it, Ambassadors of hunger and Fiumana and The journey of the workers which is the real sketch of the definitive painting - had been conceived and completed by Pellizza a Volpedo, working in the atelier for the execution of the large preparatory cartoons of single figures and groups, for which the fellow villagers posed as models, but then painted it outdoors, bringing the large canvas to Piazzetta Malaspina, where his pointillist painting could be substantiated by the full and warm summer light. Pellizza sent Il Quarto Stato in 1902 to the Quadriennale of Turin, and the capital of his Piedmont seemed to him a harbinger of good wishes. Like any painter, although fond of his work, he did not want to bring it back to his studio and hoped that that large canvas - for which he could not hope for a private buyer - would be taken into consideration for official purchases, of the royal house or of the ministry, in the certainty that, in terms of form and content, it deserved an official and public seat: it would have been a victory for art and for the people. Instead the canvas, whose subject generated a certain embarrassment among right-thinking critics and potential buyers, remained unsold and not awarded and returned to Volpedo's studio, accompanied only by the esteem of some friends, such as Giovanni Cena, who prophesied a long duration for the painting. in time. The strength of the work, however, was consolidated at a popular level and in this context the purchase by the Municipality of Milan also matured in 1920, by public subscription promoted by councilors of the socialist area, with the destination to the Gallery of modern art. of the Sforza Castle. The artistic qualities of the work returned to the fore, also enriching the understanding and interpretation of the subject, starting from 1970 with the Italian Divisionism Exhibition, which marked the beginning of an increasingly prestigious exhibition process both in Italy (from Milan to Alessandria, Turin, Rome) and abroad (from London to Washington, Paris).\n\n[Text taken from \"Cent'anni di Quarto Stato\", illustrative brochure of the centenary events (Volpedo, 2 - 30 September 2001)]"

Situated along the Cambridge Turnpike, it was an inn where stagecoach drivers had changed horses as far back as the eighteenth century. During the Revolutionary War, the inn served as General Baum's headquarters and field hospital. Its checkerboard front made the house a distinctive landmark that was remembered long after it burned in 1907. \r\nMoses painted a number of versions of \"Checkered House,\" in both winter and summer. When asked how she managed to come up with a new composition each time, she said she imagined the scene as if she were looking at it through a window. By then shifting her viewpoint slightly, she could cause the elements to fall into place differently."

Upon his arrival, he contracted with Laura for private art lessons, and thereafter asked her to marry him. Although her father originally refused due to their age difference (she was 18, he was 34), he relented on the condition that the two got to know each other first. Apparently the match was good, as they stayed married for the rest of their lives. Alma-Tadema used his wife, Laura Therese Alma-Tadema, who was a painter in her own right, as a model in many of his paintings, The Women of Amphissa of which is the most prominent example.   "

Ashton's most consistent advice was to paint the landscape, in front of the motif and although his own canvases rarely bear witness to this advice, many significant painters in the early twentieth century heeded it.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 Ashton and A.J. Daplyn camped on the banks of the Hawkesbury River north of Sydney, and this work is a result of that trip. Sketching for the 'Picturesque Atlas of Australasia' made Ashton more aware of particular traits of specific locales and painting with Buvelot in 1880 may also have heightened a receptivity to different atmospheric effects. Under Ashton's influence Richmond and the Hawkesbury were to become much frequented by artists in subsequent decades."

Lee's surrender on April 9, 1865, and President Abraham Lincoln's assassination five days later, Homer's canvas depicts an emblematic farmer, revealed to be a Union veteran as well by his discarded jacket and canteen at the lower right. His old-fashioned scythe evokes the [i]Grim Reaper[/i], recalling the war's harvest of death and expressing grief at Lincoln's murder. A redemptive feature is bountiful wheat\u2014a northern crop\u2014which could connote the Union's victory. Referring to death and life, Homer's iconic composition offers a powerful meditation on America's sacrifices and its potential for recovery.\n\nIn terms of artistic strategy, Homer's painting seemingly blends [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/realism]Realist[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/impressionism]Impressionist[/url] techniques in what would be described as a uniquely American style. The working figure of the soldier, painted in a relatively naturalistic style, suggests the hard labor of the solitary figure under the bright sun as he swings his tool across the wheat. By comparison, the wheat reads as Impressionistic, even though this painting dates before the beginnings of the Parisian style or Homer's trip to France. As Nicolas Cikovsky (curator at the Washington National Gallery) writes, \"It had been Homer's practice to paint out of doors well before he went to France, so it cannot have been Impressionism \u2011 even in the improbable event that he knew of it - that introduced Homer to the practice of open-air painting. It had been a central part of his artistic method virtually from his beginnings as a painter.\" The blending of naturalistic and impressionist styles in this and other works from the late 1860s are thought by many to have yielded a strong influence on American Impressionism, which, while focusing on different subjects, adopted some of the same loose brushstrokes."

        "description": "Although Jan Steen was not a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/landscape#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]landscape[/url] painter, he showed interest in the genre in the earlier stages of his career and produced a number well-known paintings, such as [i]Winter Landscape[/i]. The painting depicts a busy winter day and people going about their daily activities on ice and land. In terms of composition, Steen broke up the ice with a patch of land, which gave a sense of depth to the landscape unfolding in the left half of the picture. \n\nUnlike many Dutch painters who chose to specialize in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/portrait#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]portraiture[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]genre painting[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/still-life#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]still life[/url] or landscape, Steen experimented with a variety subjects throughout his career. Therefore, his period of landscape painting is a testament to his expertise and artistic range. According to Steen\u2019s biographers, the artist studied under several painters. In Utrecht, he was a pupil of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nikolaus-knupfer]Nicolaes Kn\u00fcpfer[/url], who was known for painting biblical and literary themes. His interest in landscape is likely related to his time with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/adriaen-van-ostade]Adriaen van Ostade[/url] in Haarlem, and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-goyen]Jan van Goyen[/url] in The Hague, who later became his father in-law. [i]Winter Landscape[/i] melds influences from different artists. Most evidently it draws inspiration from the art of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/isaac-van-ostade]Isaak van Ostade[/url], who was the brother of Adriaen van Ostade and part of the same studio. The slightly earlier [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/isaac-van-ostade/winter-landscape][i]Winter Landscape[/i][/url] (1645) by Isack van Ostade shares some important elements with Steen\u2019s version. The two paintings have a diagonal composition and the silhouetted figures on the ice. There is also similar lighting defining the path to the bridge in each of the paintings.\n\n[i]Winter Landscape[/i] is probably the most traditional landscape painting made by Steen. In his art, Steen had a tendency to emphasize the narrative aspect of the painting, and in other landscape paintings such as, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/village-festival-with-the-ship-of-saint-rijn-uijt][i]Village Festival with the Ship of Saint Rijn Uijt[/i][/url] (ca.1653) the figures are more dominant in the overall settings. In [i]Winter Landscape[/i] there are some clearly defined figures, while others are merely silhouettes executed in a sketchy style. In the foreground left of the center, there is a well-dressed couple looking at the activities. They are a motif that appears in other paintings by Steen, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/village-fair-1651][i]Village Fair[/i][/url] (ca. 1650-1651) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/peasant-wedding][i]Peasant Wedding[/i][/url] (1672). In [i]Winter Landscape[/i], the pair wearing North Holland costumes in the left foreground is modeled after the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hendrick-avercamp]Hendrick Avercamp[/url] in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hendrick-avercamp/winter-scene-on-a-frozen-canal-1620][i]Winter Scene on a Frozen Canal[/i][/url] (ca. 1620), that features the same characters in the second row of figures.\n\nAlthough the precise date of the painting is not confirmed, it is known that [i]Winter Landscape[/i] was listed in a 1651 sale in The Hague. It was bought by Harald Appelboom, the agent of Karl Gustav Wrangel, the Swedish statesman and military commander. As a result it seems likely that Winter Landscape was painted with the intention of being sold at the open market. After Wrangler\u2019s death in 1676, the painting was passed to his eldest daughter who followed her father\u2019s wishes to preserve his estate, the Skokloster Castle in Sweden. The painting is on display at the castle to this day."

The Japanese-inspired floral pattern on the curtain hanging at left reflects the artist's interest in the Japanese aesthetic, with his signature butterfly symbol visible in the upper right corner.\n\nAlthough the arrangement of forms may seem simple, there is a deliberate balance of shapes at play, with the rectangular shapes of the picture on the wall, the curtain, and the floor stabilizing the sitter's form. Anna McNeill Whistler, a deeply religious woman, posed for her son after a model cancelled, but due to her age, she was seated instead of standing.\n\nWhen the painting was purchased by the French government in 1891, it became the first American work to receive this honor. This elevated Whistler's reputation and helped him secure wealthy American patrons. The painting has become iconic and is widely interpreted as a symbol of motherhood, mourning (due to the colors used), or American Puritan stoicism (because of the sitter's clothes). It has inspired other artists, including Albert Herter and Henry Ossawa Tanner, and has appeared in popular culture through movies, cartoons, and advertisements."

        "description": "This painting was made in 1964, while Botero was still experimenting with what was soon to become his signature style. Called [i]boterismo[/i], it is characterized by highly stylized volumetric figures and objects, the flatness of surface and simplification of the color palette. As in this painting, Botero often painted portraits after famous works from an art history made by Old Masters - [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci]Da Vinci[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez]Velazquez[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres]Ingres[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas]Degas[/url], etc. This type of artistic citation is quite common to the era of postmodernism. The style he uses in this painting could be easily characterized as naive or primitive on the basis of artistic manner, but in fact, the concept of his artworks is more postmodern then naive. The artist uses the legacy of pre-Columbian art as well as the tradition of Western painting, and creates a complex mixture of styles.  Also, the irony and caricature simplicity are often part of his artistic manner, by which he gives a critical comment on the society he lives in.\n\nOversized [i]Pope Leo X[/i], painted after [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portraits-of-leo-x-cardinal-luigi-de-rossi-and-giulio-de-medici-1518]Raphael\u2019s portrait[/url], shows banality of copying older artworks, as well as the banality of our expectations from art and portrait paintings. Raphael\u2019s work shows us a seriousness of the facial expression, a dedication to details, and a naturalism in the depiction of the character, while Botero\u2019s painting shows none of these. Pope Leo X is represented oversimplified in form, grotesque in his size, in quite monochrome colors, and almost without any paraphernalia. Reducing the figure of the Pope to what it may be seen, in the 21st century, - as a figure that continues tradition without keeping the essence of it,- Botero humorously plays with the role of the Pope, as well as the role of artist, doomed to cite Old Masters. This is his personal reflection on the tradition of Western art, but also on the way a postmodern observer perceives past artworks."

        "description": "Gabriele M\u00fcnter created the large painting \"Kandinsky and Erma Bossi at the Table\" based on a pencil sketch in which she spontaneously recorded the situation of a table conversation between Kandinsky and the artist friend of hers. The two artists are sitting at a table with a short white tablecloth in a corner of the Murnau living room, framed by a black wall paneling that underlines their intimacy and togetherness. Kandinsky lectures with his hand raised, while Erma Bossi, who has known Kandinsky since they worked together in the 'Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung M\u00fcnchen', listens intently.\n\nWhile the woman is included in the black and white of her surroundings and her leaning figure with her arms propped up is turned towards the speaker, attention is focused on his figure with the bright blue jacket and the light blue glasses. These two shades of blue reappear several times in the picture, for example in the simple blue and white tableware or in the royal blue of the decorative objects on the shelf above them.\n\nAs in \"Zulisten (Bildnis Jawlensky)\", M\u00fcnter's concern here was not so much to trace the portraits of her two comrades as to filter out what is characteristic of the situation as in an extract. For M\u00fcnter, this seemed to manifest itself in a certain formal perception, because \"Kandinsky and Erma Bossi at the Table\" is also characterized by simple, tense formal relationships. The open and closed rectangles, which surround the pair in the middle with a well-considered systematic approach, play an important role in streamlining the design and concentrating on essential points.\n\nIn brief allusions, M\u00fcnter also describes the interior of the Murnau house with its collection objects, the folklore of which Kandinsky adapts in country costume with rough sandals and stockings. With the image of this lively table conversation, M\u00fcnter also captures something of the atmosphere of the lively discussions of those years and Kandinsky's claim to intellectual leadership with a sure grip and quiet comedy.\n\n[url href=https://www.lenbachhaus.de/en/discover/collection-online/detail/kandinsky-und-erma-bossi-am-tisch-30012207]lenbachhaus[/url]"

As the still-handsome Gray leads an increasingly dissolute and evil life, his painted representation rots and decays, revealing the extent of his moral corruption. Albright's renown as a painter of the macabre made him the ideal choice of Albert Lewin, the director of the movie, to paint the horrific image of Gray. Although the movie was shot in black and white, Lewin filmed the painted portrait in color to emphasize Gray's shocking transformation."

The painting depicts the cathedral standing resolutely against a turbulent sky, with a rainbow arching over it. The composition is filled with symbolism, and its meaning has been the subject of much interpretation.\n\nIn addition to the rainbow, the painting also includes a number of other symbolic elements. For example, the cathedral itself is a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of adversity. The storm clouds that surround it can be seen as a metaphor for the struggles and challenges that Constable himself was facing in his personal life. The dark, brooding sky may also represent the mood of the nation at the time, which was undergoing significant social and political changes.\n\nDespite the turbulence of the sky, the painting also contains moments of serenity and beauty. The river that runs through the foreground is depicted in tranquil shades of blue and green, while the trees and foliage are rendered in lush, vibrant colors. This contrast between chaos and calm gives the painting a sense of depth and complexity, and reinforces the idea that beauty can be found even in the darkest of times.\n\nSalisbury Cathedral from the Meadows is widely regarded as one of Constable's greatest works, and has been the subject of numerous critical studies and interpretations. Its emotional power and complex symbolism continue to captivate viewers and scholars alike, and it remains an enduring testament to the genius of John Constable."

From the left to the right, the panels depict God creating Eve from one of Adam\u2019s ribs, earthly humans engaging in all types of sins, and a portrayal of the journey into hell. This journey through good and evil is a much less terrifying tale, as it details the many sins of humans, yet does not detail the frightfully lurid and shocking horrors under the watchful eye of the prince of hell. The outer panels of the triptych, when closed, detail a character called the wayfarer, who makes his way through the panels and through the journey from good to evil, allowing the viewer to place himself inside the world of the triptych, and take the journey along with him.

        "description": "Since the late 1990s, Currin has taken inspiration from the mood and atmosphere of Flemish and Italian Renaissance paintings to explore the cliches, biases, and sexual desires hidden just beneath the surface of mainstream culture.\n\nIn this image, he leaves behind the overt pop-culture references and aesthetics, so at first glance it appears to be a much older painting than it truly is. The figure's loosely tousled hair, body, and mien bring to mind the Classical muses, nymphs, and goddesses of artists like Botticelli. In contrast, there is something about her face that is out of sync with more classical depictions of women. She looks toward the viewer expectantly, and there is a breathless, seductive quality to her expression conjuring the wanting ingenue or fragile waif immortalized by contemporary fashion models of the time such as Kate Moss. She epitomizes heterosexual male desire, an eager and beautiful thing to be taken and possessed. This awareness of being watched coupled with an apparent urge to be seen as desirable imparts the figure with a distinctly twentieth-century subjectivity.\n\nMany critics have pointed out the woman's resemblance to Currin's wife, Rachel Feinstein, who often filled the role of his model and muse. Because he painted this piece during the early days of their marriage, likely when they were still in the \"honeymoon\" phase of their relationship, the work may be seen as an expression of Currin's newly wedded bliss."

        "description": "[i]Madame X[/i] (1883-1884) by John Singer Sargent caused a great deal of scandal when it was first exhibited at the 1884 Paris Salon. Even though the painting was named Madame *** (later changed to Madame X), the subject was easily recognizable as the young socialite Virginie Am\u00e9lie Avegno Gautreau. Unlike most of Sargent's portraits, [i]Madame X[/i] was not a commission: the artist sought out Gautreau and asked to paint her. \n\nGautreau was an unconventional beauty known for lavender powdered skin and a highly stylized appearance. Sargent believed she was a great charmer and a subject worthy of grand portrait that would excite Parisian art circles. Both American expatriates, the two had overlapping ambitions as they were establishing themselves in Parisian high society. Gautreau was encouraged by her mother to accept Sargent\u2019s offer. In June 1883 the artist traveled to Gautreau\u2019s estate in Brittany to execute [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/madame-gautreau-1883]preliminary studies and sketches[/url] for the portrait. Depicting Gautreau\u2019s painted skin was a challenge for Sargent; he struggled at times to capture the artificial blue and lavender tones of her complexion. At one point, Sargent became so frustrated with his unsuccessful attempts that he decided to start a new portrait, leaving the unfinished version [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/study-of-mme-gautreau-1884][i]Study of Madame Gautreau[/i][/url] (Madame X) (ca. 1884). \n\nAll parties were anticipating success and were unprepared for the devastating outcome: the painting received more ridicule than praise, and it was panned for being a distasteful display of vanity. For the salon audience, the artwork was too brazen: Gautreau's pose is sensual and suggestive, and her presentation is lavish and extravagant. She wears a sumptuous satin gown, a black dress that stands in contrast to her artificially pale skin. Gautreau was known for her bold use of makeup, which was still uncommon among French upper classes. Women were encouraged to use cosmetics moderately to achieve a \u2018natural look\u2019 with slightly colored cheeks and lips or thickened eyebrows and eyelashes. \n\nSargent defended his work vigorously saying his depiction was accurate to reality and his sitter\u2019s appearance. He resisted the negative criticism, which prompted Gautreau\u2019s mother to beg him to take the painting down. Even though [i]Madame X[/i] remained at the Salon, Sargent did make one amendment. When the portrait was first presented the right shoulder strap on Madame X\u2019s dress falls off the side, an element that contributed to the suggestive and sexual nature of the painting. Sargent repainted the shoulder strap but resisted pressures to make any further changes. \n\nGautreau was publically humiliated and mocked for her American crudeness. Later, her beauty was captured by other artists in portraits like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/antonio-de-la-gandara/portrait-of-mme-pierre-gaudreau-1898][i]Madame Pierre Gautreau[/i][/url] (1898) by Antonio de La G\u00e1ndara and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-claude-etienne-courtois/madame-gautreau-1891][i]Madame Gautreau[/i][/url] (1891) by Gustave Courtois. Sargent was also humiliated: critics compared [i]Madame X[/i] to a plastic idol or ghost. After the Salon Sargent left Paris and moved to London, where he continued to build his career. [i]Madame X[/i] remained in Sargent\u2019s possession until 1916, when the artist finally sold the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Sargent remarked that the portrait was probably the best work he ever produced. \n"

Whereas some believe that the middle panel, which depicts a fantastical world of nudes in sexual engagement, large fruits, and other suggestive elements, is simply an illustration of paradise lost, others believe that it is a moral warning, which will lead you to hell, as it is depicted in the third panel of the series. Although there are many contradictory explanations, it is generally thought to be a warning against lust, one of the seven deadly sins. "

We see before us, spread laterally across the picture surface, an uninhabited cityscape. The background consists of the sky, punctuated by the hotel sign, telephone poles, and vents - all indicators of contact with people and the outside world. In the middle ground sits the hotel itself, with shops below at street level, in front of which is a fence separating it from - at the same time, it unites with - the foreground chain link fence and railroad tracks. These railroad tracks also connect to the outside world, leading, as they do, out of town. They contrast with the homey, but stately and enduring, presence of the warmly lit hotel. The streetlamp at the far right balances all the horizontals in the painting while helping to fill in the negative space of the sky. Significantly, it is not lit - it is the warm light of day on the rich stucco surface that has captured the artist's attention. The artist's treatment of the formal elements of this work points to his innate sense of the abstract surface, which would become characteristic of his work.\n\n[url href=https://www.theartstory.org/artist/diebenkorn-richard/]By Theartstory[/url]"

Returning to France at the end of 1847, he obtained his first success at the Salon of 1850-1851 with La mal'aria (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay), a painting representing peasants from the Pontine marshes. He traveled again to Italy in 1853-1855 and arrived in San Germano, in the north of the country, on the morning of October 28, 1853. From the window of the room he rented, he discovered the spectacle of young girls selling hay - les fienaroles - and decides to stay to make a table. He immediately looked for models, transformed his room into a workshop and remained there until January 7, 1854.\nThe finished work is presented in Paris at the Salon of 1857. It is because he is tired of history painting and workshop conventions that H\u00e9bert turns to subjects of everyday life, drawn from the Italian countryside. His preference goes towards young girls with pensive and smoky eyes. This approach is not without analogy with the realism of time, despite a certain sentimentalism. In a letter to the landscape designer Jules Dupr\u00e9, written from San Germano, H\u00e9bert explains his new orientation: \"I want to talk about what led me to come and do a painting in a bad inn in the Apennines [... ]. I have resolved not to paint more than the thing or the fact that will have moved me. I believe that it is the best way to remain truly an artist and to walk in the path of originality \".\n\n(Info from the site: translated, and added )"

His promotion to flag-rank coincided with the outbreak of the Seven Years War in 1756 and he served as second-in-command to Admiral Holbourne in the abortive attempt to seize Louisbourg and Cape Breton from the French. By becoming Governor of Greenwich Hospital in 1771 and a Member of Parliament for Plymouth in 1774, he appeared to have ended his sea-going career. In the American Revolutionary War, however, Admiral Keppel's resignation during the crisis following the Battle of Ushant in 1778 left a vacancy for command of the Channel fleet. Hardy was brought out of retirement to fill the post and successively kept the fleet deployed, despite Franco-Spanish numerical superiority, until the threat of invasion had passed. Hardy sat for the portrait in February and March 1780 and died the same year, while still in command.\r\n\r\nThe artist was an important portrait painter of the late eighteenth century, generally ranked third after Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. In 1773 he moved to Italy for two years, where he became interested in history paintings in the elevated and \u00e9litist 'Grand Manner'. This developed into improving upon nature and the pursuit of perfect form. At its best his work demonstrated refinement, sensitivity and elegance, although it could also be repetitive and monotonous. As a society painter he typified late-eighteenth-century English artists who, compelled by the conditions of patronage to spend their time in producing portraits, could only aspire to imaginative and ideal painting. By 1780 Romney's portraits, according to Horace Walpole, were 'in great vogue' and he worked in an increasingly neo-classical style."

This gap between the image and the word takes the painting to another dimension. Dumas clearly draws a parallel between the Nazi regime and the policies and practices of apartheid. In the mid-1980s, when she finished this painting, apartheid was at its height. Dumas joined other South African artists engaged actively in diverse political, social and cultural critique and resistance. Under this new light, the portrait here tends to be interpreted differently. Dumas in the painting does not seem as light but much more thoughtful. She looks behind her, to where she comes from, with an ironic smile. As a white person in South Africa, using a self-portrait is a strong political statement, making the painting even more powerful. Questioning her own identity, Dumas places herself with humility as a potential perpetrator of evil acts and glances at the viewer as if saying: It could have been me, it could have been you."

The diagonal of her torso as she turns, the play of light suggesting movement in her lace collar and her sleeve, and her facial expression, lips open as if beginning to smile, create a sense of lively immediacy. On the easel to the right, an animated musician dressed in blue, is playing a violin and singing along. The painting within a painting further emphasizes Leyster's self-presentation as a masterful painter of genre works. Here she innovatively compares the arts of music and painting in the echoing diagonals of the musician's bow and the painter's brush, while her use of cropping makes the painting seem almost as spontaneous as a snapshot.\n\nLeyster's treatment here is a noted innovation of self-portraiture as, in effect, she is marketing her brand, as the musician depicted here is copied from her most popular work The Happy Couple (1630). At the same time, X-rays have shown that painting on the easel was originally a girl's portrait, probably a self-portrait, and as art critic Peter Schjeldahl wrote, \"the literal self-effacement tells a melancholy tale, but the painting is a joy and, retroactively, a feminist icon.\" The artist's brush points at the musician's crotch, a bawdy allusion common to the time. Beneath Leyster's vibrant surfaces, Schjeldahl notes, \"social and sexual anxieties tingle with fire-alarm immediacy.\"\n\nIn the years following her death, Leyster's work disappeared, as her works were attributed to Frans Hals, or to her husband, the painter Jan Miense Molenaer. In 1893 the Louvre purchased The Happy Couple (1630), believing it to be a work of Hals, only to discover Leyster's signature and trademark, a star symbol playing upon the meaning of her last name \"lodestar.\" Though the work had been much praised by critics when attributed to Hals, subsequently they demoted the work for its \"weakness.\" Feminist art scholars, such as Linda Nochlin, and artists like the Guerrilla Girls, beginning in the 1970s, launched a revival of interest in Leyster's work."

A light from the left of the figures shines down upon them, bathing the girl in sunlight, and her companion in soft shadows. Although it is a realistic rendition of an everyday image, Murillo depicts in such a way as to romanticize the simple act of buying fresh fruit on the street. "

        "description": "[i] A View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm[/i]  is generally known as [i]The Oxbow[/i]. At first glance, this painting may seem to be nothing more than an exciting view of a recognizable bend in the Connecticut River. But when viewed through the lens of n19th-century political ideology, this painting eloquently speaks about the widely discussed topic of westward expansion.\n\nWhen looking at [i]The Oxbow[/i], the viewer can see that Cole used a diagonal line from the lower right to the upper left to divide the composition into two unequal halves. The left-hand side of the painting depicts a sublime view of the land, a perspective that elicits mood of danger and fear. This mood is enhanced by the gloomy storm clouds that seem to pummel the not-too-distant middle ground with rain. This part of the painting depicts a virginal landscape, nature created by God and untouched by man. It is wild, unruly, and untamed. Within the construction of American [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/landscape]landscape[/url] painting, American artists often visually represented the notion of the untamed wilderness through the \"Blasted Tree\", a motif Cole paints into the lower-left corner. That such a formidable tree could be obliterated in such a way suggests the herculean power of Nature. \n\nIf the left side of this painting is sublime in tenor, on the right side of the composition, we can observe a peaceful, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/pastorale]pastoral[/url] landscape that humankind has subjugated to their will. The land, which was once as disorderly as that on the left side of the painting, has now been overtaken by the order and regulation of agriculture. Animals graze, crops grow, smoke billows from chimneys, boats sail upon the river. What was once wild has been tamed. The thunderstorm, which threatens the left side of the painting, has left the land on the right refreshed and no worse for the wear. The sun shines brightly, filling the right side of the painting with the golden glow of a fresh afternoon.\n\nWhen viewed together, the right side of the painting\u2014the view to the east\u2014and that of the left\u2014the west\u2014clearly speak to the ideology of Manifest Destiny. During the 19th century, discussions of westward expansion dominated political discourse. The Louisiana Purchase of 1804 essentially doubled the size of the United States, and many believed that it was a divinely ordained obligation of Americans to settle this westward territory. In [i]The Oxbow[/i], Cole visually shows the benefits of this process. The land to the east is ordered, productive, and useful. In contrast, the land to the west remains unbridled. Further westward expansion\u2014a change that is destined to happen\u2014is shown to alter the land positively.\n\nAlthough Cole was the most influential American landscape artist of the first half of the 19th century, he was not entirely adverse for figure painting. Indeed, a close look at [i]The Oxbow[/i], reveals an easily overlooked [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url] in the lower part of the painting. Cole wears a coat and hat and stands before a stretched canvas placed on an easel, paintbrush in hand. The artist pauses as if in the middle of the brushstroke, to engage the viewer. This work, being a kind of \"artist in his studio\" self-portrait, is akin in many ways to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-willson-peale]Charles Willson Peale[/url]'s work [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-willson-peale/the-artist-in-his-museum-1822][i]The Artist in His Museum[/i][/url] (1822). In each, the artist depicts himself in his setting. For Peale, this was his natural history museum in Philadelphia. For Cole, this was the nature he is most well known for painting."

        "description": "At the age of nineteen, Leonora Carrington discovered [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url] through Herbert Read\u2019s book on the movement ([i]Surrealism[/i], London 1936). She was drawn into the movement\u2019s orbit through her relationship with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-ernst]Max Ernst[/url], developing her own richly individual imagery that grew out of her childhood obsessions. In the period 1937-41, added impetus came from the tensions engendered by Ernst\u2019s rejected wife, Marie-Berthe Aurenche, and then by his imprisonment on the declaration of war. Escaping occupied France, Carrington crossed into Spain in a state of mental collapse and eventually reached Portugal in 1941, only to encounter Ernst travelling with the American collector Peggy Guggenheim to New York.\n\n[i]Do you know my Aunt Eliza?[/i] includes one of Carrington\u2019s central images: the horse. The robed and horse-headed figure with a crucifix towers over a sinister accomplice. The imagery is ambiguous, as Carrington often used the horse as a sign of dynamism and speed and sovereignty. This aspect is seen most notably in her major early painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonora-carrington/self-portrait-inn-of-the-dawn-horse-1938][i]The Inn of the Dawn Horse[/i][/url] (1938), but also in the frozen horse in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonora-carrington/portrait-of-max-ernst-1939][i]Portrait of Max Ernst[/i][/url] (1939), whose pose, incidentally, anticipates that in [i]Do you know my Aunt Eliza?[/i] \n\nIn [i]Do you know my Aunt Eliza?[/i], however, the atmosphere is darkly threatening, the horse\u2019s eyeless gaze is matched by the blind stare of its human accomplice. In the context of the artist\u2019s lapsed Catholicism, this image recalls the biting parody of religion found in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya]Francisco Goya[/url], whose bleak etchings may also be remembered in the dense hatching of this drawing. \n\nIt has been inferred, from the quality of the materials and the finish, that the ink drawings (of which [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonora-carrington/i-am-an-amateur-of-velocipedes-1941][i]I am an Amateur of Velocipedes[/i][/url] is another), were made once Carrington had reached New York in 1941. They evidently relate closely to more hurried pencil sketches made as part of Carrington\u2019s therapy under Dr Morales in Santander in 1940. The horse image appears in many of these with a similar ambiguity, oscillating between nightmare and self-identification. The artist relived her breakdown in the searing novel Down Below (1943), but a note to her father (that at one time accompanied the sketches) gives, with raw immediacy, a sense of the collapse: \u2018It is difficult for you to imagine what very hard work it is to reconstruct a complete nervous wreck ... I think you had better know that I have been very close to lunacy\u2019.\n\nThe question that serves as this drawing\u2019s title is inscribed on the back. Just as with [i]I am an Amateur of Velocipedes[/i], it can be related to Carrington\u2019s story [i]Little Francis[/i]. This tells of the destructive rivalry for Uncle Ubriaco\u2019s affection between Amelia, his daughter, and her cousin Francis. These characters thinly disguise Marie-Berthe, Ernst, and Carrington herself, the conflict that, in part at least, precipitated her breakdown. The central passages, which focuses on Francis (the Carrington figure), concern his attempts to retain Ubriaco. On being forced to move-on by the imminent arrival of Amelia, he sings \u2018rather dejectedly\u2019, while cycling:\n\nDo you know my Aunt Eliza? Wha, ha, ha, ha, haa.\nShe is blue but don\u2019t despise her. Wha, ha, ha, ha, haa.\nNow you\u2019ll excuse me laughing like I\u2019m inclined to do \u2013\nBut, do you know my Aunt Eliza? Wha, ha, ha, ha, haa.\n\nThis curious ditty goes without explanation in the text. Recalling the nursery rhymes of childhood, in which Carrington saw parallels to Surrealist concerns, it bears a sense of deeply concealed meanings. It is notable that Francis sprouts a horse\u2019s head when Ubriaco returns to Amelia. This seems to allude to the white rocking horse that Carrington had kept in the Parisian flat she shared with Ernst, while also being a physical sign of dejection and abandonment."

        "description": "Even though servants and kitchen maids were recurring characters in 17th century Dutch [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting?select=featured#!#filterName:featured,viewType:masonry]genre paintings[/url], Jan Vermeer\u2019s [i]The Milkmaid[/i] is a unique example, in which the kitchen maid is the subject of a single figure portrait. The milkmaid is fully absorbed in her activity, carefully pouring the milk. Even though the surrounding objects indicate that the milkmaid is in a kitchen, the indoor setting was kept relatively bare. X-ray studies of the painting show that Vermeer decided to eliminate a wall hanging, probably a map, from the back wall. Additionally, there was a basket of clothes in the right corner that the artist replaced with a footwarmer. By making these adjustments, the artist placed greater emphasis on the milkmaid and her activity. \n\nThis representation stands in contrast to other depictions of servants by his contemporaries, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolaes-maes/the-idle-servant-1655][i]The idle servant[/i][/url] (1655) by Dutch Golden Age painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolaes-maes]Nicolaes Maes[/url]. In [i]The idle servant[/i], Maes constructs a narrative, the kitchen maid that fell asleep in front of a heap of dishes and then was found by her mistress. Like most genre paintings, this painting has a moral aspect: the mistress gestures towards the sleeping maid and the dishes, as a warning against idleness. In comparison, [i]The Milkmaid[/i] does not present a story or anecdote, it simply describes a moment in time. For this reason, Vermeer\u2019s composition displays only a limited space, directing the viewer\u2019s attention to the milkmaid\u2019s activity.\n \nVermeer\u2019s milkmaid has a strong physical presence, created through expert use of light and shade. The light source is coming from the window and immersing the milkmaid in daylight. The artist created a light and dark contrast between the maid and the rear wall, in which the shaded parts of the wall correspond to where the light falls on the woman\u2019s figure. Similarly, on the right side, the wall is lightest in order to enhance the shaded portion of the maid\u2019s figure. Vermeer also emphasized her silhouette by painting a white contour line along her arm and shoulder. It was suggested that the pose of Vermeer\u2019s milkmaid was inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/domenico-fiasella]Domenico Fiasella[/url]\u2019s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/domenico-fiasella/queen-artemisia-1645][i]Queen Artemisia[/i][/url] (ca. 1645).  Generally speaking, it would be unusual for an artist to base a genre painting of a kitchen maid on a portrait of an ancient Greek queen. However, given Vermeer\u2019s deviation from common depictions of servants in [i]The Milkmaid[/i], the connection to Fiasella\u2019s [i]Artemisia[/i] becomes more plausible. Vermeer depicted his milkmaid with empathy and dignity, and according to some the character also conveys morality. The portrayal of the maid concentrated on her work can relate to virtuosity and modesty, ideals of womanhood in Dutch 17th century society. The milkmaid displays her virtue through her diligent preparation of food. There are some elements in the painting that are indicative of romantic love, namely the footwarmer and the cupid tiles bordering the lower edge of the floor. However, because both of these are not prominent in the painting, it is unlikely that romantic love is the central theme. In this context, the footwarmer and the tiles symbolize human caring and the maid\u2019s devotion toward others. In this way, these elements contribute to the central theme of the milkmaid pouring milk and providing nourishment."

Hicks may have viewed parallels in the two parts of the composition, inasmuch as Penn, who had introduced Quakerism into Pennsylvania, had also brought about a measure of the peaceable kingdom on earth."

        "description": "Possibly Anguissola's most recognisable work, The Chess Game is an intimate insight into the domestic, female world of sixteenth century Italy. Three young girls can be seen playing chess in the foreground, while an older woman, perhaps the Anguissola family's maid, is sitting behind them and watching their game. On the left, the artist's younger sister, Elena, gazes calmly towards the viewer while her hands indicate that she has just defeated her sister who sits on the right. Minerva, with her hand raised in defeat and disbelief, gazes with parted lips at the conqueror. The youngest girl, Europa, stands beside Elena and grins cheekily at the despondent loser. Her laughing expression recalls the drawing of the laughing girl in Boy Bitten by a Crawfish that Michelangelo had so admired, and perhaps this was Anguissola's sly way of immortalising her praised work. The painter has masterfully captured the details in the elaborate clothing of her sisters, using her pigments to highlight the braids wrapped around their heads, or the ruffled collars under their chins.\n\nThrough her paintbrush Anguissola has transformed a mundane, everyday interaction between sisters into drama. She used the scene to depict a number of artistic genres and skills including landscapes, fabric textures, and the human face at different stages of life, perhaps to highlight the scope of her talent. The landscape and detail on the oak tree behind the girls display her skill at depicting flora, while the chessboard and table with its Turkish carpet that butts up against the frame and into the viewer's space is not only showcasing her power in depicting still life but also seems to have influenced the later painter, Caravaggio, who often used jutting elbows, table corners and dirty feet to protrude into his audience's space.\n\nAs a woman in Renaissance Italy, it was thought to be too indecent for her to study the naked human form from life, and so the grander historical paintings or Biblical portraits such as St Sebastian, Adam and Eve or the death of Caesar were considered too racy. Thus, many of Anguissola's earlier work focuses on family members and self-portraits. But, like in this case, the subject is often given an unexpected dimension: her sisters here play a game of skill and strategy that hints at their intellectual potential."

One day, frightened for no apparent reason other than that of a power cut which inconvenienced and possibly frightened the sisters, they brutally murdered the mother and daughter of the family while the man of the house was out at work. In working with the story, Paula Rego seems to have focused on the unnatural closeness of the sisters, both to each other and the mother and daughter they murder. Ambiguity and menacing psychosis reverberate within the picture, much of it carried in the objects with which the room is claustrophobically furnished. And isn\u2019t there something uncertain about the sexuality of the seated figure?"

        "description": "One of the most famous works by Paul Gauguin, [i]Vision After the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel[/i] (1888) was painted during the artist's stay in Pont-Aven, Brittany. The painting refers to the biblical story of Jacob, who crossed the river Jabbok and spent the night wrestling a mysterious angel. The artist depicts the subject indirectly, showing a group of Breton women after a sermon in church. The women moved by the sermon see a vision of Jacob wrestling the angel.\n\nThe available information about the painting comes primarily from two sources: letters written by Gauguin and writings by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emile-bernard]Emile Bernard[/url]. Bernard spent the summer of 1888 with Gauguin in Pont-Aven \u2013 the two worked side by side, and while Gauguin painted [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i] Bernard worked on the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emile-bernard/breton-women-in-the-meadow-1888][i]Breton Women in the Meadow[/i][/url] (1888). The two paintings share stylistic similarities and are both examples of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cloisonnism]Cloisonnism[/url] \u2013 a post-impressionist style characterized by bold flat forms enclosed by dark outlines. Both artists also shared an affinity for Japanese art, and Bernard wrote that the motif of [i]Jacob wrestling the angel in Vision After the Sermon[/i] was modeled after [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai]Hokusai[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai/all-works#!#filterName:Theme_sumo-wrestlers,resultType:masonry]Sumo Wrestlers[/url].\n\nGauguin used the term [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/synthetism]Synthetism[/url] to describe paintings such as [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], in which he aimed to synthesize between the outward appearance of the subject, the artist\u2019s emotional response to the subject, and the aesthetic considerations of line, form, and color. In [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], Gauguin creates a synthesis between two realities: the everyday life of the Breton women and their vision of the biblical event. In a letter to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent Van Gogh[/url], he wrote about the sermon that inspired the painting: \u201cFor me, the landscape and the fight only exist in the imagination of the people praying after the sermon which is why there is a contrast between the life-size people and the struggle in its non-natural disproportionate landscape\u201d. For this reason, Gauguin emphasized the contrast between the dramatic fight scene and the serenity of the women quietly praying.\n\nBy weaving together different Christian symbols, Gauguin added new content and meaning to the religious subject. In the foreground, he depicted twelve Breton women in prayer, a symbolic reference to Jacob\u2019s twelve sons, the predecessors of the twelve tribes of Israel. The apple tree in the center of the composition was another non-traditional addition to the story of Jacob. In the bible, the apple tree is a symbol of knowledge, a reference to man\u2019s awakening, and subsequently his fall from grace. In [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], the apple tree is full and lush, suggesting the possibility of man\u2019s redemption and a possible return to paradise. Another important component is the bull emerging from the left corner of the painting. The bull is possibly a sacrificial animal, and as such, it can hint to the sacrifice of Christ and the chance for redemption. The bull is also connected to Breton, it is a symbol attributed to four Breton saints. In this way, Gauguin formed a connection between his unique symbolism and the spirituality of the devout Breton women."

Thomas Cole, the founder of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/hudson-river-school]Hudson River School[/url] of landscape painting, visited Niagara Falls for the first time in May 1829. He sketched the falls, writing of his experience there, \u201c[i]I anticipated much\u2014but the grandeur of the falls far exceeds anything I had been told of them\u2014I am astonished that there have been no good pictures of them\u2014I think the subject a sublime one[/i].\u201d\n\nThe canvas expresses the untamed spirit of the waterfall that so impressed Cole. As was typical, he did not execute the painting directly from nature; his letters indicate that he finished it in London the following year. The completed image bears little resemblance to the actual site in the 1830s, which included factories, scenic overlooks, and hotels to accommodate a growing number of tourists. In his romanticized depiction of the pristine landscape\u2014definitively identified as American by the Native American figures\u2014Cole created a nostalgic look back at the vanishing wilderness of the United States."

Unlike Courbet or Millet, Caillebotte does not incorporate any social, moralizing, or political message in his work. His thorough documentary study (gestures, tools, accessories) justifies his position among the most accomplished realists.\n\nCaillebotte had undergone a completely academic training, studying with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leon-bonnat]Bonnat[/url]. The perspective, accentuated by the high angle shot and the alignment of floorboards complies with tradition. The artist drew one by one all the parts of his painting, according to the academic method, before reporting them using the square method on the canvas. The nude torsos of the planers are those of heroes of Antiquity, it would be unimaginable for Parisian workers of those times. But far from closeting himself in academic exercises, Caillebotte exploited their rigor in order to explore the contemporary universe in a completely new way.\n\nCaillebotte presented his painting at the 1875 Salon. The Jury, no doubt shocked by its crude realism, rejected it (some critics talked of \"vulgar subject matter\").

Artschwager uses such effects to depict common objects or places, but his subjects take on enigmatic and mysterious overtones through these subtle explorations of perception and through his muted palette and strangely irregular surfaces.

        "description": "Hopper and his wife Jo traveled to Mexico in the summer of 1943, seeking a change of scene and new subjects for Hopper's art. After stopping in Mexico City, they traveled 500 miles north to Saltillo, a smaller city whose cool, dry climate and views of nearby mountains made it a popular destination for vacationers. The Hoppers stayed at a hotel called the Guarhado House on Victoria Street, and Hopper painted several watercolors from the hotel roof. From this height, he could see the mountains over the buildings of the city, but his depictions of the scene still suggest the urban development that was blocking his enjoyment of the natural setting. In another work, he showed the colorful towers of Saltillo's eighteenth-century cathedral, a reminder of the city's roots as a Spanish settlement; here, however, he limits his scope to a partial view of some domestic architecture. The houses' simple, blocklike forms, trimmed with lattices and decorative carving, are a dazzling white against the sky and the distant hills. Hopper had initially complained that Saltillo was noisy and congested, but from his rooftop he could project onto this new setting the same stillness and solitude that pervaded his scenes of New York and New England."

        "description": "\"First Communion\" was Picasso\u2019s first large-scale work. The canvas was painted in the atelier of Jos\u00e9 Garnelo Alda, where Picasso was completing his training following the advice of his father. Garnelo, a friend of Jos\u00e9 Ruiz\u2019s and the brother of a fellow student of Picasso\u2019s at La Llotja, was himself an art teacher who specialised in religious and moralising subject matter, so Picasso had a range of liturgical objects at his disposal on which to base his composition. In all likelihood, Jos\u00e9 Garnelo and Picasso\u2019s father chose the motif of this oil painting that would be presented at the Exposition of Fine Arts and Crafts held in Barcelona in 1896, for such subject matter was usually distinguished with the prizes that Jos\u00e9 Ruiz hoped his son would win at the official salons. Furthermore, Garnelo was very familiar with the theme, for three years before he had painted a similar scene of a young girl, portrayed from the front and dressed for the occasion. The painting is balanced as befits academic standards, and presents a group of figures comprising the little girl dressed for the ceremony, kneeling before a missal on a prie-dieu (in whom we recognise Lola, the artist\u2019s sister), the male character acting as godfather (who has been identified as Doctor Vilches, a friend of Picasso\u2019s father\u2019s) and the godmother (the latter\u2019s wife, according to Palau i Fabre). The three figures appear in profile on three different planes, thereby giving depth to the composition, which is balanced by the figure of the altar boy (the couple\u2019s son). The light source for the scene is located outside the picture plane and reveals Picasso\u2019s technical command, surprising for his age, which is also evinced by the translucence of the girl\u2019s veil, the altar boy\u2019s surplice and the altar cloth, despite their conventionalism. The colour of the painting is also characteristic of the period and befits the religious subject matter: red hues for the walls and the prie-dieu, forming a contrast with the brilliant white of the girl\u2019s dress. The discreet motifs of the carpet and the striped cloth, along with the bright cheerful colours of the altar flowers enhance the colouring of the ensemble. Two studies for First Communion in a sketchbook in the museum\u2019s collection show the figure of Lola kneeling before the prieu-dieu reading the missal, and other sketches and depictions of the altar boy are also kept in the museum.\n\n[url href=https://museupicassobcn.cat/en/node/1024]museupicasso[/url]"

        "description": "[i]Isabella and the Pot of Basil[/i] (1907) is an example of the mature work Waterhouse produced in the first decade of the 20th century. The painting is based on a Romantic tale included in [i]The Decameron[/i], a collection of novellas by 14th century Florentine poet Giovanni Boccaccio. Later, the story was adapted by the English Romantic poet John Keats in the 1820 poem [i]Isabella, or The Pot of Basil[/i]. According to the story, a Florentine maiden named Isabella falls in love with Lorenzo, who works for her two merchant brothers. Upon realizing this, her brothers, who wanted her to marry a high-ranking nobleman, decide to murder Lorenzo and bury his body in the forest. Lorenzo appears to Isabella in a vision and tells her the location of his corpse. After this, Isabella exhumed his head and hid it in a pot of basil. The plant grew rapidly as it was nourished by the water of Isabella\u2019s tears. Eventually, Isabella\u2019s brothers discover her secret and they steal the pot away. Without the plant, Isabella withers away and dies of overwhelming grief.\n\nWaterhouse depicts Isabella kneeling on the grass in front of the pot of basil in a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/high-renaissance#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Renaissance[/url] style garden with lush and leafy foliage. The artist suggests the melancholy of the scene by decorating the pot\u2019s pedestal with an ominous skull. Isabella\u2019s kneeling pose was utilized by the artist in the earlier painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/mariana-in-the-south-1897][i]Mariana in the South[/i][/url] (1897), which is based on a poem by Alfred Tennyson about a Renaissance maiden abandoned by her lover. In both instances, Waterhouse used the same model, who makes recurring appearances in his work from the 1890s. In [i]Isabella and the Pot of Basil[/i], she appears with her long flowing red hear, rosy cheeks but also puffy eyes that are reddened from crying. The story of Isabella was also popular with earlier generations of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood]Pre-Raphaelite[/url] artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt]William Holman Hunt[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt/isabella-and-the-pot-of-basil-1867][i]Isabella and the Pot of Basil[/i][/url](1868) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais]John Everett Millais[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/lorenzo-and-isabella][i]Isabella[/i][/url] (1848-1849). Waterhouse\u2019s [i]Isabella and the Pot of Basil[/i] bears most similarities to Hunt\u2019s version. In both cases, the composition focuses on Isabella embracing the pot of basil, however, unlike Waterhouse\u2019s painting, Hunt\u2019s version is set indoors.\n\nWaterhouse drew inspiration for his paintings in classical literature, as well as in poetry by Tennyson and Keats. Around the time he painted [i]Isabella and the Pot of Basil[/i], Waterhouse also produced [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/phyllis-and-demophoon-1905][i]Phyllis and Demophoon[/i][/url] (1905) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/apollo-and-daphne-1908][i]Apollo and Daphne[/i][/url] (1908) \u2013 two stories from Ovid\u2019s [i]Metamorphoses[/i]. Like the story of Isabella, the stories from [i]Metamorphoses[/i] highlight human transformation into a natural form: Phyllis\u2019s spirit takes the form of an almond tree, while Daphne transforms into a laurel tree. These stories represent the passage from death to eternal life, which results from circumstances of fierce passion and violence. The paintings not only demonstrate Waterhouse\u2019s profound knowledge of classic and romantic sources, but also his concerns with themes of desire, death, regeneration, and immortality."

As a budding artist, Mondrian began painting simple pastoral landscapes of his home country, and these paintings evolved from those beginning artistic ideas. In the abstraction of the color of the tree and the simple design, Mondrian\u2019s aesthetic style is already present in this simple landscape. This post-impressionistic piece was only a stepping stone in the artist\u2019s development into his ideal form of neo-plasticism.  "

In 1696, when this picture was made, the whole of Belsize belonged to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey (the Abbey and other landmarks are visible on the horizon). The road in the foreground is what is now Rosslyn Hill. The coach is heading towards Hampstead.\r\nThe country house and estate portrait, of which Siberechts was the most accomplished practitioner, was a fashionable genre in Britain by the late seventeenth century. The typical bird's-eye view allows a maximum amount of detail to be depicted, including possibly the best recorded vegetable and fruit garden of the period."

By keeping accouterments to a minimum, David avoids indicating the sitter's rank and lineage. Penrose, a British-born member of a prominent Quaker family, was a successful businessman and landowner but was criticized by the Society of Friends for his lavish tastes. The commissioning of this spartan portrait may have been intended to combat that criticism. David brings the sitter down to earth by positioning the head lower on the canvas than is traditional in French portraiture.

The figures include people from all levels of society, including his friends and acquaintances, a nude representing the academic tradition of art, a child, and a dog, all the while Courbet is painting a landscape scene. In 1855, Courbet presented the painting to be displayed at the Paris World Fair, but it was refused entrance due to space concerns (the canvas was roughly 11 feet by 20 feet). Courbet thus took forty of his paintings and displayed them alongside the gallery in his own exhibition.  \r\n\r\nThis 19 foot long painting is an expression of Courbet's self-love and pride in his iron will, hard work and revolutionary genius. Just as he heroicized others in the Burial at Ornans, he does the same for himself in this work. With a good measure of egotism, Courbet expresses that things get done and attitudes change when people think for themselves and challenge the status quo. Courbet places himself full-size, brush in hand, working on a landscape picture. His friends on the right are emblematic of kindred spirits and innovation, while the admiring boy is an expression of Courbet's confidence that his legacy will transcend generations. The nude model standing behind the artist affirms his greatness and her role as muse. To the left stand the working poor, Courbet's recognition of their right to be included. His nemesis, Napoleon III, is presented as a poacher holding a firearm, accompanied by his dogs. Courbet's chin-up gaze trumps Napoleon's downward tipped head in an expression of the innovator dominating over the authoritarian."

It shows the marketing of seven young people, ranging in age from children to young adults, as slaves. Both male slaves, as well as three of the female slaves, bear a similarity in appearance perhaps suggesting that they are members of a family forced into slavery by economic conditions. All are wearing tags to indicate their availability as slaves. The taller, standing, young woman is wearing a translucent garment which clearly shows her breasts and pubic hair--she is trying to shield her eyes, perhaps because her potential buyers include former friends and neighbors, who are probably seeing her nude for the first time. The auctioneer eats his lunch with a very casual attitude.\r\n\r\nFrom a common type of Salon academic art of the period, it depicts an eroticized scene clad as a history painting, as was customary at the time in Paris. Boulanger had visited Italy, Greece, and North Africa, and the painting reflects his attention to culturally correct details and skill in rendering the female form."

In his landscapes, C\u00e9zanne aimed to reveal the inner geometry of nature, saying he wanted \u201cto make of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionism[/url] something solid and durable, like the art of museums\u201d.\n\n[i]Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley[/i] (1882-1885) is an early example of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Series_mont-sainte-victoire,resultType:masonry][i]Mont Sainte-Victoire[/i] series[/url], which shows the mountain rising above the Arc River Valley. The scene was likely painted from his sister\u2019s property at the top of the hill behind her house. C\u00e9zanne included details of the property, as well as the walls, fields, and neighboring farmhouses. Another important element is the railroad viaduct with a moving train on the bridge. Cutting through the landscape, the railroad viaduct resembles a Roman aqueduct and recalls the paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Nicolas Poussin[/url], like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin/the-finding-of-moses-1638][i]The Finding of Moses[/i][/url] (1638). In a letter, C\u00e9zanne wrote to a friend and writer \u00c9mile Zola, dated April 14, 1878, he described the train passing through the railway bridge at Arc River Valley as a \u201cbeautiful motif\u201d. He included architectural elements to enhance the landscape and to contrast between the natural landscape and the manmade environment.\n\nIn early paintings of Mont Sainte-Victoire, elements like trees and foliage were used to frame or break up the composition. In [i]Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley[/i], the trees in the center interrupt the composition, while in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/mont-sainte-victoire-with-large-pine-1887][i]Mont Sainte-Victoire with Large Pine[/i][/url] (c. 1887) the tree on the left frames the composition. Creating the contrast between the mountain and the trees in the foreground, C\u00e9zanne explored different ways of making Mont Sainte-Victoire the focal point of the composition. In later paintings, C\u00e9zanne removed these elements, and in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/mont-sainte-victoire-1906-5][i]Mont Sainte-Victoire[/i][/url] (c.1902-1906) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/mont-sainte-victoire-1906-4][i]Mont Sainte-Victoire[/i][/url] (c.1904-1906) the mountain dominates the landscape. The later paintings also had a limited palette of green, blue, grey, and cream, that emphasized the grandeur of the landscape.\n\nC\u00e9zanne\u2019s landscapes were also influenced by Japanese art, and there are certain parallels between his [i]Mont Sainte-Victoire[/i] series and the landscapes of Mount Fuji by artists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai]Katsushika Hokusai[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hiroshige]Utagawa Hiroshige[/url]. The composition of [i]Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley[/i] resembles Hokusai\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai/lake-suwa-in-the-shinano-province][i]Lake Suwa in Shinano Province[/i][/url] (c.1829-1833) that depicts trees in the center with Mount Fiji in the distance.\n\n[i]Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley[/i] was owned by American industrialist Henry Osborne Havemeyer and his wife Louisine Havemeyer. The couple were avid art patrons and collectors and were among the first to bring Impressionist and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] art to America. After Henry Osborne Havemeyer died in 1907, the painting was passed on to his wife, who donated it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York after her death in 1929."

        "description": "It is as if in this painting Kahlo tries on the role of wife to see how it fits. She does not focus on her identity as a painter, but instead adopts a passive and supportive role, holding the hand of her talented and acclaimed husband. It was indeed the case that during the majority of her painting career, Kahlo was viewed only in Rivera's shadow and it was not until later in life that she gained international recognition.\n\nThis early double-portrait was painted primarily to mark the celebration of Kahlo's marriage to Rivera. Whilst Rivera holds a palette and paintbrushes, symbolic of his artistic mastery, Kahlo limits her role to his wife by presenting herself slight in frame and without her artistic accouterments. Kahlo furthermore dresses in a costume typical of the Mexican woman, or [i]La Mexicana[/i], wearing a traditional red shawl known as the [i]rebozo[/i] and jade Aztec beads. The positioning of the figures echoes that of traditional marital portraiture where the wife is placed on her husband's left to indicate her lesser moral status as a woman. In a lithograph made the following year called [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/frida-and-the-miscarriage-1932][i]Frida and the Miscarriage[/i][/url] (1932), the artist does hold her own palette, as though the experience of losing a fetus and not being able to create a baby shifts her determination wholly to the creation of art.\n\nFrieda gave this painting to art collector Albert Bender in gratitude for the USA entry visa he helped to acquire for Diego. Rivera had previously been refused entry into the USA due to his Communist party affiliation. In the title of this printing, Frida uses the German spelling of her name: [i]Frieda[/i]. The banner at the top of the painting proclaims: \"Here you see us, me, Frieda Kahlo, with my beloved husband Diego Rivera. I painted these portraits in the beautiful city of San Francisco California for our friend Mr. Albert Bender, and it was in the month of April of the year 1931\". When the painting was finished, a San Francisco newspaper described the work as being: \"...valuable only because it was painted by the wife of Diego Rivera \".\n\nThis painting was shown at the \"Sixth Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists\" - the first public showing of Frida's work."

The bird, shown in profile, turns toward the viewer with an alert, evocative expression.\n\nKnown for his innovative painting of the effects of light, here Fabritius used light and shadow conveyed in subtle tones to create a three-dimensional effect. He also used trompe d-oeil to make the painting appear real as it was hung in the kitchen, slightly above eye level, where the Dutch often kept goldfinches as pets. As Marco della Cava wrote of the work it is \"a stark and faintly modernist rendition,\" with its fresh and simple immediacy, but the Calvinist audience of the era would have also have seen the goldfinch as a symbol of the resurrection, as its red spots and its feeding upon thistles were associated with Christ's passion.\n\nFabritius was only thirty-two when he was killed and most of his works were destroyed in a 1654 gunpowder explosion in Delft that destroyed a fourth of the city. Nevertheless, he was among the most admired of Rembrandt's students and would go on to influence Vermeer.\n\nThis enigmatic painting is at the center of Donna Tartt's novel The Goldfinch (2013), which is being made into a feature film of the same title."

At many locations in the world he had to endure the many hardships of life and to, moreover, prove his presence and competence through being serious, loyal and perseverant.\n\nLife for the Palestinians did not stop at any place in spite of its harshness, limitations and the arbitrariness of the laws.\nPalestinian popular life persisted in the face of all kinds of oppression, whether in the areas which became under Israeli occupation within occupied Palestine (1948), or those areas occupied by Israel in 1967 (the West Bank & Gaza). Thus, Palestinian living became subject to the changes which imposed a new pattern for the behavior and life of Palestinians, in the social, cultural, economic and political senses.\n\nYears passed and the Zionist dream pertaining to the dissolution of the Palestinian personality and its extinction did not materialize. In effect, the Palestinian community remained cohesive and with a presence, maintaining its heritage and traditions.\n\nThe life of the Palestinian communities continued with its happy and sad moments- through a wedding or a new-born, or through the return of someone abroad. The Palestinian toiled in all available arenas and in all professional specializations.\n\nThe symbols of the homeland remained lofty- where Jerusalem takes pride in the sanctity given to it by God, with its Mosques and Churches, grand by virtue of its history and heritage. All the Palestinian cities, moreover, take pride in the bequest of the forefathers in terms of everlasting relics telling the narratives of history and past glory.\nUpon the passing of a few years from the hour of the catastrophe a new pattern of Palestinian life began to prevail inside the camp and outside of it. This new pattern laid the ground for relative stability, aiding the Palestinian individual to re-evaluate what happened and, likewise, to ponder what could happen."

The artist\u2019s virtuoso technique, in combination with a propensity to shock, revived painting at a time when the medium had been eclipsed by video and installation art. From his earliest canvases, Currin\u2019s commitment to paint the female nude has always recognized the entanglement between content and form. As the artist himself has said, \u201cI think that painting has always been essentially about women, about looking at things in the same way that a straight man looks at a woman. The urge to objectify is more a male urge than a female one, and painting is one of the most personal and succinct methods of male objectification of the female\u201d.\n\nIn Nice \u2018n Easy, the luminous creamy skin of two nude women is highlighted by the velvety green background their bodies are presented upon. Their auburn hair is aloft, lifted by an unseen wind that gives the painting a \u201cromantic,\u201d as in relating to golden love, and \u201cRomantic,\u201d as in highly expressive of emotion, quality. The slighter woman on the left places her hand diagonally on the rounded belly of her companion, who looks wistfully into the distance. Currin has purposefully left the narrative ambiguous. It is unclear if the woman caught in a day dream is pregnant, especially since distended and exaggerated anatomies were a signature of the artist\u2019s paintings of nude women up until the point that Nice \u2018n Easy was painted. Small breasts, full round bellies and sinuous hips were also a signature of the Renaissance masters [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli]Sandro Botticelli[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lucas-cranach-the-elder]Lucas Cranach the Elder[/url], whose canvases Currin looks to as inspiration."

        "description": "[i]The Laughing Cavalier[/i] stands out among Hals\u2019s works of male portraiture, because of the vibrant coloring and exuberant costume. The treatment and details of the painting indicate that this was a commissioned portrait for a man of high stature. Hals demonstrates his virtuosity and skill through the exquisite execution of the textures and garment details, painting the beautiful gold and silver threaded embroidery and delicate lace layers in the collar and the cuffs. \n\nEven though the identity of the sitter is not firmly established, the painting offers helpful clues. The portrait features an inscription, which states that the subject is 26 years old, confirming that he was born in 1597 or 1598. It is also likely that he resided in Haarlem, as Hals almost exclusively portrayed citizens of Haarlem. The embroidery has motifs of arrows, oil lamps encircled by bees, that symbolize the pains and pleasures of love: the arrows pierce the heart, and the bees signify how the lovesick are drawn to the flame of love. These indicate that the man was an unmarried gentleman. The staff of mercury, another motif of embroidery, alludes to trade activities as a possible sitter\u2019s occupation.\nIn recent years, the art historian Pieter Biesboer presented substantial evidence that the man in the portrait is Tieleman Roosterman, a wealthy Haarlem merchant. The identity of the sitter was narrowed through the year of birth and the assumption that he resided in Haarlem. \n\nWhen examining Hals\u2019s works of commissioned portraiture, stylistic differences are depending on the social identity and occupation of the subject. For example, when depicting Haarlem\u2019s ruling class, in portraits such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/portrait-of-jacob-pietersz-olycan][i]Portrait of Jacob Pietersz Olycan[/i][/url] (1625) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/nicolaes-woutersz-van-der-meer-1631][i]Nicolaes Woutersz van der Meer[/i][/url] (1631), the appearance is relatively subdued. The portraits reflect their status as political leaders - their poses are static and dignified, while their costumes are simple and black. In contrast, Hals\u2019s portrayals of the Haarlem elite were executed in a more casual and dashing style, as in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/willem-van-heythuyzen][i]Willem van Heythuyzen[/i][/url] (1625) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/portrait-of-isaak-abrahamsz-massa-1626][i]Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz Massa[/i][/url] (1626). Expressly, Hals reserved this style for a clientele of wealthy Flemish merchants, who immigrated to Haarlem after the fall of Antwerp. [i]The Laughing Cavalier[/i] was conceived in the same kind of style, and correspondingly Tieleman Roosterman was of a similar background and status. Most importantly, Hals painted another portrait of Roosterman 10 years after [i]The Laughing Cavalier[/i], in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/portrait-of-tieleman-roosterman-1634][i]Portrait of Tieleman Roosterman[/i][/url] (1634). Even though the men in the paintings are 10 years apart, a physical resemblance exists. The overall facial features are similar, as well as the hair and the eye color.\n\nInterestingly, there is a small detail that can be found in both paintings, a minute scar that parts the eyebrow hair in the left eyebrow. The embroidered motifs in [i]The Laughing Cavalier[/i] also reinforce the possibility that Roosterman is the sitter. Roosterman was indeed a bachelor at the time and a merchant by trade. Furthermore, the Roosterman\u2019s family coat of arms has arrows on its crest and a figure that holds an arrow, making another connection between Roosterman and the decorated costume in [i]The Laughing Cavalier[/i]."

This location was a popular spot for many Impressionist artists, including Monet, who found inspiration for their works in this area. The painting itself features a pleasing visual arrangement of three horizontal color bands, separated by the presence of a young boy on the right side of the canvas. The wheat that gives the painting its title is located at the center of the canvas, drawing the viewer's gaze to it.\n\nMorisot's loose brushwork renders the wheat in a hazy manner, while the buildings in the background are painted with slightly more clarity, revealing the smokestacks of the factories that dominate the horizon. This contrast highlights the changing nature of the landscape from agricultural to industrial, reflecting the city's growth and the gradual disappearance of the rural way of life. In the foreground, a figure emerges from the edge of the wheat field, carrying his belongings on his shoulder. This figure could represent the archetypal rural villager who is trying to flee from the encroaching industrialization. Hence, Morisot's artwork can be interpreted as both a charming representation of the countryside and a subtle critique of modern life's transformation, a theme that many French painters, from the Realists to the post-Impressionists, found popular."

Day of the Gods (Mahana No Atua), one of the very few paintings Gauguin completed during this period, is closely related to his literary project. Set in a Tahitian landscape by the sea, the composition is divided into three horizontal bands. At the top, islanders perform a ritual near a towering sculpture. Like many figures in Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian images, the monumental sculpture was derived not from local religion but from photographs of carved reliefs adorning the Buddhist temple complex at Borobudur (Java). In the middle band, three symmetrically arranged figures are placed against a field of pink earth in poses that may signify birth, life, and death. The woman in the center, formally linked to the sculpture at the top, is similar in appearance to other depictions of Tahitian females who Gauguin used to suggest the Christian figure of Eve in paradise. The lower portion of the composition evokes brilliant, contrasting hues reflected in the water. Gauguin\u2019s Post-Impressionist style, defined by a decreasing tendency to depict real objects and the expressive use of flat, curving shapes of vibrant color, influenced many abstract painters of the early 20th century."

He travelled to Italy between 1773-75 and was in Naples during the autumn of 1774. Although the last eruption of Vesuvius was not long before (1767), Wright of Derby visited the area during a quiet period of volcanic activity and so did not witness a major eruption. While he was in Italy, he researched the volcano through descriptions by Sir William Hamilton, British ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples and a fellow of the Royal society who studied both Vesuvius and Mt Etna. Through Hamilton and other sources, Wright could have gained access to a number of paintings and visual accounts of the volcano's eruptive history, from which he made sketches and paintings. The Painting contains a strong impression of the sublime, a theme that prevailed during the Pre-romantic period in Europe. This sense of nature's awesome power is illustrated in the way that Wright's Vesuvius utterly dwarfs visible signs of human influence on the landscape. Despite living in Italy for quite a length of time, this particular painting was begun and completed once Wright of Derby had returned to England."

        "description": "The Volpedo exhibition has as its central fulcrum a \"rediscovered\" masterpiece by Pellizza, woven by sophisticated relationships of light, backlight and subtle iridescences: it is Spring Idyll, a work conceived and begun by the painter in 1896. Writing to his friend Casciaro in fact, on October 3, 1896, declared: \"I have four sketched works of three I have already spoken to you the last sketch a few days ago is an Idyll that if I can finish next spring I will send to the Venetian exhibition\": Pellizza identified in falling asleep in autumn the first moment of nature, inspiring the work that would later find, in the spring regeneration, harmonies and lights to be translated on the canvas with a \"less showy\" and more refined pointillism than that previously practiced in works such as Sul barn and which had for a long time engaged in the rebalancing of the dominant blue and bluish intonations.\n\nThe canvas, which in Pellizza's projects was intended as the first of a series dedicated to developing the theme of the Idylls, occupied the painter above all in 1899 but was only completed in 1901, when the planned cycle had given way to a more complex program of pictorial sequences intended to celebrate Love, within which the canvas was part of, constituting the first panel, but also Life, Work, Motherhood, Death. For these works the painter had prefigured general compositional schemes that alternated shapes in the round, in square, in rectangle, thinking of possible multiple mixes of themes and subjects. A complex project that had forced him to set up several canvases at the same time that required long execution times and that only in some cases were completed.\nSpring idyll although completed in 1901 did not leave Volpedo's studio until 1903 when the painter sent it to the fifth Venice Biennale; with this work he intended to underline his quality as a symbolist painter, confirming the tendencies made explicit at the III biennial of 1899 with Self-portrait (now Florence, Uffizi Gallery), but no longer insisting on the symbolic value of specific objects, and instead focusing on a evocation of meanings capable of transcending the materiality of nature above all through the concatenation of compositional rhythms, chromatic harmonies and luminous and iridescent suggestions.\n\nIt also seemed a turning point with respect to the Fourth Estate which had sparked lively discussions at the First Quadrennial of Turin in 1902; but, in fact, the Idyll sent to Venice was not so far from the other work that the painter had sent to Turin, the beautiful Sunset, now better known under the title Il roveto (Piacenza, Galleria Ricci Oddi): a pure landscape in a pulsating backlight that seems to evoke the vitality and regenerative force of nature through an effective search for luminous effects of backlighting and transparent shadows, a vision resulting from the profound need to recover the organic and organicistic bond with nature that was one of the ways in which international symbolism was expressed.\n\nThe symbolist and decorative value of Spring Idyll prompted Pellizza to send the work the following year to the Glaspalast in Munich - in transalpine environments which, from Bocklin to von Mar\u00e9es to Hildebrandt, had not been insensitive to the symbolist lesson of Puvis de Chavannes - , and later in 1905 in Angers together with a sequence of beautiful landscapes but also with The mirror of life (Turin GAM) and The procession (Milan Museum of Science and Technology), and then in Rome, for the annual Exhibition of the Society Amateurs and Connoisseurs of Fine Arts in 1906. Here the canvas was sold, with the direct involvement of the painter - then in Rome for some time and engaged in elaborating some landscapes in Villa Borghese - to a merchant from Amsterdam and, from Holland, to an unspecified date passed in the United Kingdom and took up residence in an English collection. The sale caused the Italian critics and collectors to lose track of the painting who, however, continued to be familiar with the image of the painting through a second similar work that was exhibited, with the title Idillio campestre in the meadows of the parish church of Volpedo at the \"Mostra individual by G. Pellizza da Volpedo \u201dat the Pesaro Gallery in Milan in the first two months of 1920, then entering the Civic Art Collections of Milan. It was probably Vittore Grubicy who, writing to Guido Marangoni, superintendent of the Castello Sforzesco, in 1919, referred to the painting indicating it as \"The girotondo\", to suggest the more concise title which then remained common from the early 1920s also in the inventories of the Gallery. The reappearance of Spring Idyll on the international art market in 1980 suddenly brought attention back to this singular double Pellizzian work, posing various questions about the nature and motivations of the execution of the Girotondo.\n\n[Text by Aurora Scotti, taken from Luce, backlight, iridescences.

Today Hoosick Falls, the closest real town to the Moses farmstead, is a sleepy hamlet, somewhat passed over by modern economic development. However, until the Great Depression, it was a bustling commercial center, its industrial potential bolstered by its situation at the confluence of the Hoosick and Walloomsack Rivers. Moses associated the area, hunting grounds of the Mohican Indian tribe, with the tales of James Fenimore Cooper. \"Some say Natty Bumpo sleeps his sleep in an unknown grave in the village limits,\" she wrote.\r\nMoses painted a number of versions of Hoosick Falls, showing the village in various seasons. Most follow the winding path of the Hoosick River, and may be based in part on old prints of the town. The bird's-eye view\u2014encompassing more than would be visible from any single human vantage point\u2014is, however, typical of Moses' unique approach."

Sheeler was not alone in his interest in these crafts; a number of influential collectors developed an interest in American folk and decorative arts in the 1920s and 1930s. In an era that placed increasing emphasis on technology and mass production, and in the years following the international crisis of World War I, such objects were nostalgic reminders of an ostensibly simpler time."

        "description": "Out of the cycle of one hundred paintings that Kane created, it is this one, Cunnawa-bum, that is used as the frontispiece in his book Wanderings of an Artist among the Indians of North America. Although the image of the young Metis woman of Plains Cree and British ancestry  featured in the book is only one of numerous portraits in the painted cycle, as frontispiece she becomes a sort of cover girl for Kane\u2019s life project. Wanderings of an Artist recounts how the young woman, whom Kane met at Fort Edmonton, held her swan\u2019s-wing fan \u201cin a most coquettish manner\u201d  and that it was her charm that inspired Kane.\r\n          No preliminary portrait sketch or drawing exists of Cunnawa-bum. Kane developed his general concept for a fan portrait through several schematic drawings of a figure holding a fan, sometimes within an oval. One of these drawings is a profile of a \u201cflathead\u201d woman; none are articulated with features that suggest an individual. In the painting the awkwardly disembodied arm implicitly suggests that Kane\u2019s focus was the beguiling fan, underlined by its trompe l\u2019oeil nudge into the viewer\u2019s space.\r\n          This strangely generic aspect of the portrait, despite its connection to an individual, is carried over into its life as the chromolithograph frontispiece to Wanderings of an Artist where its title becomes the anonymous Portrait of a Half-Breed Cree Girl. According to the ethnologist Daniel Wilson (1816\u20131892), a friend of Kane\u2019s who reviewed Wanderings of an Artist, the oil captures the racial duality of the sitter; Wilson writes that Kane\u2019s painting \u201cpresents an exceedingly interesting illustration of the blending of the white and Indian features in the female Half-breed.\u201d Wilson is criticizing the work of the chromolithographer, Vincent Brooks, who had \u201csacrificed every trace of Indian features in his desire to produce his own ideal of a pretty face, such as might equally well have been copied for an ordinary wax doll.\u201d\r\n          For the artist, ethnographer, and lithographer, respectively, the essence of Cunnawa-bum\u2019s charm was presented as a fan, in her identity as a half-breed, and as a wax doll. It is perhaps in Cunnawa-bum\u2019s best interest that modern viewers shift the focus to the meaning of her name\u2014\u201cOne That Looks at the Stars\u201d\u2014as a way to subvert the nineteenth-century male gaze and recognize her as empowered."

After the Duke of Alba's death in 1796, Goya likely became involved with the Duchess, who was known for her beauty, curvaceous figure, alabaster complexion, and voluminous black curls. In this portrait, painted the year after the Duke's death, the Duchess poses in mourning black as a maja, a member of Spain's lower classes known for their bold behavior. She points toward the ground, where Goya has lightly drawn his name in the sand. When the painting was restored, the word \"solo\" was uncovered next to Goya's name, suggesting that he was her only love. Although the painting was commissioned by the Duchess, Goya kept it in his possession for 15 years, indicating his strong attachment to the work and its subject. Art historians speculate that the end of their affair may have led to the imagery that would populate Goya's later works, depicting women as fickle temptresses, men as cuckolded fools, and lovers tortured by uncontrollable passions."

        "description": "[i]Annunciation[/i] (ca. 1472) is one of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s earlier works, which was commissioned by the church of San Bartolomeo in Monte Oliveto. Leonardo painted with oil and tempera on wood, an untraditional choice since oil was usually used on canvas. From its rectangular shape and size, the painting was likely intended for the sacristy (a room where priests prepare for service and objects of worship are held) of the newly renovated church. Prior to 1869, [i]Annunciation[/i] was attributed to Florentine painters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/domenico-ghirlandaio]Domenico Ghirlandaio[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrocchio]Andrea Verrocchio[/url]. However, radiographic and spectrographic tests as well as newly discovered preparatory sketches indicate that Leonardo painted [i]Annunciation[/i] while he was training in the workshop of Andrea Verrocchio. Various sketches by Leonardo, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/lily][i]Lily[/i][/url] (1473-1475), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/sleeve-study-for-the-annunciation-1473][i]The Study of a Sleeve[/i][/url] (1473), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/the-study-of-a-drapery-of-a-figure-kneeling][i]The Study of a Drapery of a Figure Kneeling[/i][/url] (1473) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/the-study-of-drapery-of-a-seated-figure-1473][i]The Study of Drapery of a Seated Figure[/i][/url] (1473) demonstrate his extensive preparatory work for [i]Annunciation[/i].\n\nThe depicted scene is based on the New Testament: the Angel Gabriel visits the Virgin Mary announcing to her that she was chosen by God to be the mother of his Son. Leonardo demonstrates innovation and creativity in his composition, which differs from the traditional depictions of the Annunciations, such as Filippo Lippi\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/filippo-lippi/annunciation-1445][i]Annunciation[/i][/url] (1445) and Fra Angelico [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/fra-angelico/annunciation][i]Annunciation[/i][/url] (ca. 1435), that portray an interior setting with a partial view of a landscape. Leonardo\u2019s [i]Annunciation[/i] is in an open courtyard of a Renaissance palace with a Tuscan landscape and seascape in the background. The landscape was painted in the [i]sfumato[/i] technique, which softens the transition between colors, so the human eye does not perceive boundaries and lines. Through this technique, Leonardo captured the diffusion of air changes, giving the illusion of a continuous flow of air and mist.\n\nLeonardo carefully conceived each element in the [i]Annunciation[/i], making complex connections to the life and death of Christ. For instance, the carpet of spring flowers relates to the religious scene: the lily whites, daisies, white champions, morning glories and lavender all symbolize the Virgin\u2019s innocence and purity. Other flowers, such as irises, passion flowers and myositis are associated with her feeling of love and mourning. Another important element in Annunciation is the marble lectern placed between the Virgin Mary and the Angel Gabriel. The lectern is a combination of a Renaissance baby cradle and a sarcophagus, thus it symbolizes both the birth and death of Christ. This is also seen in other paintings like Raphael\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/holy-family-known-as-the-grande-famille-of-francois-i-1518][i]The Holy Family of Francis I[/i][/url] (1518) and Lorenzo Lotto\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lorenzo-lotto/madonna-with-st-jerome-and-st-anthony-of-padua-1521][i]Virgin and Child with Saints Jerome and Nicholas of Tolentino[/i][/url] (1524). Leonardo decorated the lectern with classical motifs like acanthus leaves, garlands, scallop shells and lion\u2019s paws. In its design, the lectern is reminiscent of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrocchio/tomb-of-giovanni-and-pietro-de-medici-1472]the sarcophagus designed by Verrocchio for Giovanni de\u2019 Medici[/url] (1472) at the Old Sacristy in the Church of St. Lorenzo in Florence. By placing the lectern in a blooming meadow, Leonardo adds another layer of meaning: the lectern alludes to a mortuary and Christ\u2019s death, while the flowers symbolize the present moment and his life."

        "description": "One of four paintings based on the myth of Hercules, Tintoretto's [i]The Origin of the Milky Way[/i], depicts the god Jupiter bringing his son Heracles, born of a mortal woman, to nurse from the breast of his wife, the goddess Juno. In a composition which anticipates the drama of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] painting, the artist creates a scene of flustered activity depicting the moment Juno awakens to discover Jupiter's deceit. According to myth, the infant Heracles would obtain immortality through breastfeeding from the goddess. However, as she awakes, Juno draws away in anger causing her milk to spray across the sky, thus forming the Milky Way indicated by an array of stars. From her other breast, milk falls toward Earth, resulting in the creation of beautiful lilies, believed to be part of the original composition (later trimmed down). Below the immortal couple, numerous cupids with bows drawn, symbolize the marital discord and its universal consequences.\n\nThe work provides visible proof of Tintoretto's skill as both a draughtsman and colorist. The foreshortening of Jupiter is reminiscent of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giotto]Giotto[/url]'s groundbreaking frescos in the Arena Chapel, the muscular Juno the influence of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo]Michelangelo[/url], but the rhythmic arrangement of figures is uniquely Tintoretto. The expert use of color in both the figures and attire relates to Tintoretto's childhood exposure to pigments in his father's workshop as a cloth dyer. The composition is built up from a carefully variegated palette which moves from intense blue to grey in the sky, and from white and gold through to orange, pink and scarlet in the draperies.\n\n[i]The Origin of the Milky Way[/i] is one of many mythological paintings Tintoretto created throughout his long career, though he is best remembered for his religious paintings. This particular series of paintings, commissioned from Rudolf II, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary, is an essential indication of the progressive artist's popularity beyond Italy. A mystery surrounds the original impetus for this painting. Some scholars believe it was first painted as a commission for the \"grand guardian\" of the Scuola Grande di San Marco, Tommaso Rangone, who had commissioned other notable works from the artist, including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tintoretto/finding-of-the-body-of-st-mark][i]Finding the Body of Saint Mark[/i][/url] (1562). After Rangone's death, the artist reconfigured this painting for the Emperor."

He could combine realistic exactitude with psychological insight, but still remain the sober observer, not involved in the inner life of his subjects. He could paint old men with the same supreme ease as young princesses, and capture the critical eyes of fellow painters as exactly as the dignity of political office, as in the portrait of Louis-Fran\u0437ois Bertin (1766-1841), one of the leading personalities between the July monarchy and the Second Empire. He established the Journal des D\u00e9bats which supported the policy of Louis-Philippe. Louis-Francois was a patron and friend of the artist, he thus accepted the commission of the portrait, as he rather painted historical paintings, as a favor to his acquaintance. Ingres\u2019 impatience with the portrait got the best of him a number of times, when he broke down in tears at not being able to find a suitable pose for the old man. Bertin, the patron himself, would have to soothe the artist, until he was able to paint him again. Ingres was finally able to finish the portrait when he came across Bertin sitting at an outside caf\u00e9 in the exact pose, after which he easily completed the portrait. This portrait  was the first of Ingres\u2019 paintings that was widely well-received. Although some critics decried its drab coloring and naturalism vulgar, the public was spellbound. \r\n\r\nAs a portrait painter, Ingres has often been compared to Holbein, and in portraiture particularly the severity of line and exactitude of detail so typical of Neoclassicism often lend the subject a touch of special historical dignity.\r\n\r\n"

        "description": "The painting [i]Cornard Wood, near Sudbury, Suffolk[/i] (1748) depicts wood located two miles from Sudbury, the artist\u2019s place of birth. Cornard Wood was common land situated on the outskirts of the village of Great Cornard. Gainsborough painted the view from Abbas Hall, looking towards the village of Great Henny with the church of St. Mary\u2019s Great Henny appearing in the background.\n\nSince the woods were not private property, the villagers could gather wood, graze donkeys and horses, dig marl for manure or sand for building materials, or simply take a walk on the path to Great Henny. In the painting, the artist depicts the activities that embody the spirit of the countryside: two donkeys stand on a mound, a man is resting from digging while a lady sits nearby, another man cuts and ties firewood, and travelers head towards Great Henny on foot and on horseback.\n\nIn a letter Gainsborough wrote in 1788 he revealed that the landscape was painted in 1748 at a time when he was still learning his craft. Gainsborough began teaching himself to paint by studying and copying landscapes of 17th-century Dutch artists, particularly Jan Wijnants and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-van-ruisdael]Jacob van Ruisdael[/url]. Dutch landscapes appealed to artists who preferred a more naturalistic approach to the ideal classical landscapes of French painters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-lorrain]Claude Lorrain[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Nicolas Poussin[/url]. The young artist could have familiarized himself with these paintings in the East Anglian collections as well as in the form of engravings. Additionally, the East Anglia countryside with its wetlands, ponds, and windmills shared similarities with the Netherlands\u2019 landscape. Like in Ruisdael\u2019s wooded scenes such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-van-ruisdael/landscape-with-a-house-in-the-grove-1646][i]Peasant Cottage in a Landscape[/i][/url] (c. 1646), Gainsborough scatters human figures around the woodland to create a harmonious and humble atmosphere. It has even been suggested that Gainsborough painted some of these early landscapes hoping to attract a clientele that was fond of Dutch art.\n\nLater in life, Gainsborough expressed a fondness and nostalgia for these early works, since he believed they demonstrated his lifelong commitment to landscape painting. He wrote about Cornard Wood, near Sudbury, Suffolk: \u201cthough there is very little idea of composition in the picture, the touch and closeness to nature [\u2026] are equal to any of my later productions\u201d. He also revealed that in a period of 40 years the painting was held by 20 different picture dealers and that at one point he even bought the painting back for himself. For a few years, the painting belonged to David Pike Watts, the uncle of the English landscape painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-constable]John Constable[/url]. Thus, Constable likely knew and admired the painting. He was born in the same area as Gainsborough and was also inspired by the local landscape. In 1800, when Constable was painting near Woodbridge in Suffolk, he wrote: \u201cIt is a most delightful country for a landscape painter, I fancy I see Gainsborough in every hedge and hollow tree\u201d."

In The Concert, Leyster accurately depicts elements such as the Baroque violin (made without a chin rest and usually supported against the chest), as well as the woman\u2019s songbook.\n\nThe figures shown here are likely portraits. Based on similar individuals in Leyster\u2019s other pictures, scholars have tentatively identified the singer as the artist herself, the violinist as her husband, and the lute player as a family friend. The members of the trio, like all musicians, must work together as a unit, \u201cin concert,\u201d which has led some writers to theorize that this scene symbolizes the virtue of harmony.\n\nLeyster frequently placed her subjects against a plain, monochromatic background. Thus, nothing distracted from the figures, who are all shown in the midst of various actions (bowing or plucking strings and beating time). The deep angle at which the lute is held adds depth to the composition. The varied directions of the musicians\u2019 gazes offer the viewer different focal points.\n\n[url href=https://nmwa.org/art/collection/concert/]National Museum of Women in the Arts[/url]"

        "description": "Typical of Freud's early period, Girl with a White Dog was created using a sable brush, which he used to apply the paint with linear precision, almost like a drawing. The subtle shading evokes a host of textures exuding softness, warmth, and the absence of immediate tension. The robe has slipped off the sitter's shoulder, exposing her right breast. Coupled with the absent stare of the woman and the dog, the muted colors and faint contours give this composition an overall flatness.\n\nThe sitter is Kitty Garman, Freud's first wife, and a noted beauty whose father was artist Jacob Epstein. The dog was one of two bull terriers they were given as a wedding gift.\n\nFreud painted many portraits of Kitty during their brief marriage, which ended in divorce in 1952, due to his chronic infidelities. A weariness in the sitter's expression, the deep hollows under her eyes and the self-supporting gesture of the hand under the left breast hint at her discontent, despite this moment of calm. The analytic distance that came to characterize Freud's brilliance as an observer is reinforced by the absence of a name in the title, despite his intimate connection to the subjects. He was able to see certain things better because he remained aloof."

        "description": "In the second half of the 1880s, after Georges Seurat and other Neo-Impressionists had exhibited their paintings at the Salon des XX in Brussels, several Belgian artists were converted to pointillism and the optical mixture of colours.\r\nThe painter George Lemman, then scarcely twenty, was among these enthusiasts. For about a decade, gradually loosening Seurat's theories, he developed an original technique, applied more particularly to portraits and landscapes. After 1891, under the influence of his fellow countryman Henri Van de Velde, his paintings showed an \"Art Nouveau\" stylisation of which the Beach at Heist is a remarkable example.\r\n\r\nThe tight network of tiny round or oval dots arranged horizontally on the canvas enabled him to create distinct coloured zones clearly separated by a line of complementary colours. These shapes took on weird, anti-naturalist contours such as the huge bluish cloud which seems to invade the sky.\r\n\r\nThe only sign of human life in this nocturnal landscape is the abandoned boat, painted in purple strokes against a background dominated by yellow and orange. The exacerbation of the colours and synthetic forms was part of the development of the Symbolist movement which opened a new era in the Franco-Belgian art community."

        "description": "[i]Weighing Cotton[/i] (1939) belongs to a series of three paintings, in which the artist displayed his vision of the American heartland. Like [i]Weighing Cotton[/i], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-hart-benton/cradling-wheat-1939][i]Cradling Wheat[/i][/url] (1938) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-hart-benton/roasting-ears-1939][i]Roasting Ears[/i][/url] (1938-1939) depict agriculture landscapes that fascinated Benton: \u201c[I am] fairly obsessed with America \u2013 the Mississippi region, the Ozarks, and the places where I can see lonely plowmen, cotton pickers, river boatmen and ramshackle houses that never were much good.'' Weighing Cotton is likely based on sketches that Benton made in the summer of 1938, while he was traveling through Louisiana, Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee, and North Carolina.\n\nLater, Benton created clay models of his figures, and then set them up in three-dimensional arrangements, which allowed him to observe and examine the composition from all angles. The Renaissance painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tintoretto]Tintoretto[/url] used a similar method to create his compositions, and Benton began this practice in 1919. In the clay study, Benton prepared the complex multi-figure composition, but he made some additions in the painting. He added a figure in the right distance and composed the scene under a wide summer sky with wooden shacks and cotton fields in the background. \n\n[i]Weighing Cotton[/i] shows an ordinary day in the cotton field, where workers are absorbed in their daily routine. In the 1930s, cotton was mainly harvested manually by black workers, whose wages were determined by the amount of cotton they picked. In the painting, the men work for a common purpose, filling the wagon with cotton, but they are not a team of equals. A central figure is a white man dressed in bright red clothing standing and holding a long-handled weighing pole. In contrast, the black figures are dressed in muted colors and are seen bending over dragging the heavy bags of cotton. In this way, the artist conveys the power dynamic, the white man\u2019s authority over the black workers. However, the dominant figure is a black woman in the foreground: she is depicted from the rear looking toward the central group. Her role in the scheme is unclear, she is dressed in a white suit and is not one of the workers. It is possible she is related to one of the workers or is passing by on her way to a special event. In [i]Weighing Cotton[/i], as in other paintings, Benton animates the composition by repeating forms and colors. For example, he repeats the curves in the bags hanging on the shoulders of workers and pickers. Similarly, the white clouds echo in form and color the bags and rows of cotton bolls on the right.\n\nBenton, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/grant-wood]Grant Wood[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-steuart-curry]John Steuart Curry[/url] were the dominant figures of the American [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/regionalism]Regionalist[/url] art movement. In their paintings, they depicted rural America, mainly the South and the Midwest. Their representation of America expressed a nostalgic view of the country, even though Benton believed in the objectivity of his art: \u201cMy American image is made up of what I have come across, of what was \u2018there\u2019 in the time of my experience \u2013 no more, no less\u201d. Still, Benton\u2019s vision in [i]Weighing Cotton[/i] represents an idealized version of America: the conditions of black workers in the cotton fields were much harsher and severe than Benton\u2019s depiction."

However, Hopper altered her face to make her younger (Jo was 44 in 1927). He also altered her figure; Jo was a curvy, full-figured woman, while one critic has described the woman in the painting as \"'boyish' (that is, flat-chested)\" \r\nAs is often the case in Hopper's paintings, both the woman's circumstances and her mood are ambiguous. She is well-dressed and is wearing makeup, which could indicate either that she is on her way to or from work at a job where personal appearance is important, or that she is on her way to or from a social occasion.\r\nShe has removed only one glove, which may indicate either that she is distracted, that she is in a hurry and can stop only for a moment, or simply that she has just come in from outside, and has not yet warmed up. But the latter possibility seems unlikely, for there is a small empty plate on the table, in front of her cup and saucer, suggesting that she may have eaten a snack and been sitting at this spot for some time."

Yet, Henri Gervex was a renowned painter. Aged only 26, he had already been awarded a medal at the Salon, which in theory made him an \"outsider\" in terms of competition and therefore dispensed from the deliberations of the jury in charge of choosing the artworks exhibited. This time, the authorities decided otherwise as they judged the scene to be \"immoral\".\n\nGervex found his inspiration in a long poem by Alfred de Musset (1810-1857), published in 1833. The text recounts the destiny of a young bourgeois, Jacques Rolla, falling into a life of idleness and debauchery. He meets with Marie, a teenager who found in prostitution an escape from misery. Rolla is seen here ruined, standing by the window, his eyes turned to the girl sleeping. He is about to commit suicide by poison.\nIf the scene was judged indecent, it was not because of Marie's nudity, which in no way differs from the canonic nudes of the time. The attention of contemporaries rather turned to the still life constituted by a gown, a garter, and a hastily undone corset covered with a top hat. Gervex might have been advised by Degas to put \"a corset on the floor\" so that the spectator may know this woman \"is not a model\". Indeed, this disposition and the nature of the clothes clearly indicate Marie's consent and her status as a prostitute. Moreover, the walking stick emerging from the garments acts as a metaphor for sexual intercourse.\n\nAfter its exclusion from the Salon, Rolla was exhibited for three months in the gallery of a Parisian art dealer. The scandal, largely echoed by newspapers, attracted large crowds. Many years later, in interviews published in 1924, Gervex recalled the pleasure he had in seeing the \"uninterrupted procession of visitors\", although it is unknown whether he had anticipated the reaction of the authorities and willingly provoked the scandal."

According to a Franchomme descendant the portrait was likely painted circa 1850-1 as a gift from Scheffer to the then-grieving cellist, whose wife died in January 1850 at the young age of 35. \n\n\nScheffer was Franchomme\u2019s neighbor and friend, and took an interest in Ren\u00e9\u2019s talent, introducing him to members of his circle. As a result, Ren\u00e9 learned composition under the direction of famed French composer Charles Gounod. In the present work, Ren\u00e9 is aptly shown holding the \u201cDuport\u201d cello, bought by his father from the son of Jean-Pierre Duport, Napoleon\u2019s favorite cellist, in 1843 for the then-record price of 22,000 francs. At the age of 18, Ren\u00e9 won first prize playing the \u201cDuport\u201d cello at the Paris Conservatoire, but died tragically several months later of pneumonia. \n\n\nBuilt in 1771 by Antonio Stradivari, the \u201cDuport\u201d cello remains one of the most important instruments surviving today, and was played by the legendary cellist Mstislav Rostoropvich from 1974 to 2007. Its visible dent is said to be the result of Napoleon\u2019s rough handling of it when he attempted to play it himself.2 Following Duport\u2019s technique and using his instrument, Franchomme advanced his elegant, light, and smooth bow technique. Franchomme became close friends with Felix Mendelssohn and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, with whom he would collaborate.\n\n\n1 See: M. Kolb, pp. 256-7.\n\n2 See: T.

Clutching her skirts, she alludes to her sexual nature, as if clinging to something slipping away. Her body lies between a blanket adorned with spring blossoms, and a sinister backdrop of red and black. Rego illustrates the conflict of reality encroaching on the socially imposed myths of female worth, construing aging as both a physical and psychological violation."

This portrait was painted in 1771 or 1772 and is likely to have been commissioned to celebrate their marriage. George Romney was the son of a furniture maker from Dalton in Furness, Lancashire. At the age of 21 he was apprenticed to the portrait painter Christopher Steele. In the 1760s Romney moved to London and went on to become a fashionable portrait painter."

        "description": "This accurately observed landscape shows the buildings of the artist's hometown of Delft, its roofs and steeples, caught in shadow and light, beneath the gathering clouds in a blue sky. The waters of the Schie Canal shimmer with rippling currents and the reflections of buildings. A number of precisely detailed people gather on the shore in the left, each of them representative of Delft life. Yet, the light here is what matters, as the sky takes up almost two thirds of the canvas, its contrasting tones creating glowing areas of illumination and the shadows of dawn. As art historian Adriaan Waiboer wrote, while \"Vermeer was truly capturing what he saw in front of him,\" he primarily \"wanted to create a special illusion...he wanted to paint light.\" Using only white, ultramarine, yellow ochre, and madder lake, a rich shade of red, the color palette is very simple yet employed with subtle tonalities to create a feeling of harmony.\n\nVermeer painted three landscapes of his hometown, and this cityscape is considered one of his masterpieces. As art historian Mari\u00ebt Westermann wrote, \"The scene's varied light effects look so natural...that the eye ignores what the mind knows: that this light is high artifice, that it is a work of painting.\" The painting led to the Vermeer's rediscovery when the French critic Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger saw it in 1842, and as a result, went on to influence subsequent artists, including Camille Pissarro, Manet, Edgar Degas, and Henri Fantin Latour. This painting is also one of the artist's most popular, as shown in its being reproduced by the Royal Dutch Mint on 2011 gold commemorative coins in 2011. The famous French novelist Marcel Proust said, \"Ever since I saw the View of Delft in the museum in The Hague, I have known that I had seen the most beautiful painting in the world,\" causing him to include the work in his seminal novel Remembrance of Things Past (1908)."

        "description": "Berthe Morisot's most well-known painting, The Cradle, depicts her sister Edma looking down at her sleeping daughter Blanche in a cradle behind a gauzy veil. The painting, completed during the early part of Morisot's career, is the first example of her exploration of motherhood as a recurring subject, which was limited by the social norms of the era that restricted women's public activities without a chaperone. Although critics praised the painting when it was exhibited at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874, Morisot failed to sell it and decided to keep it within her family.\n\nMorisot's composition is based on two interconnected triangles: one framing Edma's body and the other, slightly taller, framing the veil around the cradle, creating a harmonious balance and a subtle connection between the mother and child. Edma is shown drawing the translucent curtain around the cradle, emphasizing the intimacy of their relationship and shielding her daughter from the viewer's gaze. The close framing of the scene, eliminating the edges of the cradle, evokes the medium of photography, which the Impressionists were known for exploring. However, Edma's expression is difficult to interpret since she has no direct connection with her sleeping daughter, who appears with closed eyes. Some scholars suggest that Edma, who painted extensively before marrying a naval officer in 1864, appears wistful, yearning for the creative freedom she had before settling into the role of motherhood. Thus, while the veil hides her daughter's form, Edma's emotions remain ambiguous and unknown."

        "description": "This dramatically intimate self-portrait announced the arrival of new talent on the Venetian art scene; Tintoretto painted it when he was 30 years old, at the beginning of his career. The picture follows the Venetian portraiture tradition of showing the subject's head emerging from a dark background and making the eyes the focus of attention. \n\nThe starkness of the composition, quite unlike his densely populated narrative paintings, was unprecedented, as the artist provides no details to indicate a place, context, or even his profession as an artist. While many artists depict themselves with the tools of their trade or wearing the finery of a gentleman, Tintoretto represents himself with an intense penetrating gaze, perhaps suggestive of peering into a mirror, and omits his hands, the very means by which the work was created. Tintoretto's gaze is truly captivating, with his head turned over his right shoulder he stares directly out, providing a confrontation with the viewer. The visibly pronounced brushstrokes, appearing as natural highlights on the artist's face from afar, seem as nearly impasto patches of paint on the surface of the composition as one approaches the work. This key feature of Tintoretto's style, found even in his earliest works, helped to set him apart from the more finished brushwork styles of his Venetian contemporaries such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese]Veronese[/url], and would influence the work of his younger contemporaries and subsequent generations of artists. \n\nThis may be the first autonomous self-portrait in European art to leave the touch of the artist so evident, functioning almost as a signature. The line that extends to the freely painted self-portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent van Gogh[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]Paul C\u00e9zanne[/url] starts here."

        "description": "Paul Delvaux painted [i]The Awakening of the Forest[/i] in the late 1930\u2019s, a time when the exposure to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealist[/url] art and ideas revolutionized his own ideas about painting. Delvaux was especially influenced by the early paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-de-chirico]Giorgio de Chirico[/url], whom Delvaux called \"The Poet of Emptiness.\" He adopted Surrealism as a visual language that would help him bring to life his inner world filled with childhood memories and fantastical settings. [i]The Awakening of the Forest[/i], like a number of his other paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-delvaux/tribute-to-jules-verne-1971][i]Tribute to Jules Verne[/i][/url] (1971), was inspired by Delvaux's childhood fascination with the French novelist Jules Verne. Here, he depicts his interpretation of a scene from Verne\u2019s [i]Journey to the Center of the Earth[/i] (1864), in which the protagonists (Professor Otto Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel) discover a prehistoric forest deep inside the Earth.\n\nDelvaux paints professor Lidenbrock on the left side, examining a rock or a fossil, seemingly oblivious to the forest of naked female bodies that is displayed in front of him. The figure standing behind the professor, gazing away from the scene, is a self-portrait of the artist in the role of Axel. On both sides, there is a female figure in long Victorian dress holding an oil lamp, attempting in vain to shed light on the scene. The rich red pigment of these figures' dresses contrast with the forest\u2019s\u2019 dark green shades and the pale complexion of the naked skin of the nudes. The forest is illuminated by a full moon, and the naked figures seem at one with the forest. Some of them combine human and vegetal elements: sprouting leaves instead of hair, they seem to embody a primordial human state. The protagonists from the book seem out of place, and even intrusive next to the naked bodies. \n\nRegardless of the large number of naked figures and their detailed portrayal, [i]The Awakening of the Forest[/i] maintains a feeling of emotional detachment and general unawareness, that only adds to the eerie effect of the painting. There is a lack of communication between the figures: they seem more or less oblivious of one another. There is a sense of alienation, an overwhelming silence, that pierces through the canvas. Delvaux creates a world of suspended and unsatisfied desires, in which all but the oblivious professor, obsessed with his work, seem to express a melancholic awareness of the unimaginable distance between their desire and its consummation.\n\nThis painting possesses all the bizarre elements that ultimately make the main features of Delvaux's work: merging of opposing components, representation of the nudes, eerie light, and the sense of unease. This painting seems largely indebted to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-riou]\u00c9douard Riou[/url], a French painter who illustrated six novels by Jules Verne. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-riou/by-series/journey-to-the-center-of-the-earth]Riou\u2019s illustrations[/url] of moonlit underground forests were tremendously influential on Delvaux\u2019s formative years."

        "description": "The Surrender of Lord Cornwallis is an oil painting by John Trumbull. The painting was completed in 1820, and hangs in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nThe painting depicts the surrender of British Major General Charles, Earl Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia on October 19, 1781, ending the Siege of Yorktown, and virtually guaranteeing American independence. Included in the depiction are many leaders of the American troops that took part in the siege.\r\n\r\nThe artist spent the early part of the American Revolutionary War as a soldier, serving as an aide to both George Washington and Horatio Gates. After resigning from the army in 1777, he pursued a career as an artist. In 1785 he began sketching out ideas for a series of large-scale paintings to commemorate the major events of the American Revolution. After spending a time in England, he returned to New York City in 1789, where he sketched a number of dignitaries whose portraits he intended to use in these paintings. In 1791 he traveled to Yorktown, Virginia, where he sketched the landscape of the surrender site.\r\n\r\nUpon his return from Britain after the end of the War of 1812, he promoted this idea to the United States Congress. On the strength of his application and the successful exhibition of Battle of Bunker's Hill, Death of Montgomery, as well as studies for other proposed paintings, the Congress in 1817 voted to commission four large paintings from him, to be hung in the United States Capitol rotunda.\r\n\r\nThe price was set at $8,000 per painting, with the size and subject matter to be determined by President James Madison. A size of twelve by eighteen feet (370 cm \u00d7 550 cm) was agreed, as was the subject matter for the four paintings: the Declaration of Independence, the Surrender of General Burgoyne, the Surrender of Lord Cornwallis, and Washington Resigning his Commission. Trumbull spent the next eight years executing the commission, completing this painting in 1820. It was displayed in New York City, Boston, and Baltimore before coming to Washington, D. C., and Trumbull supervised its hanging in the Capitol rotunda in late 1820. It has remained there ever since. Trumbull himself cleaned and varnished the painting in 1828, and it has been periodically maintained since. In 1971, damage from a penny that was thrown hard enough to pierce the canvas was repaired. All of the Rotunda paintings were most recently cleaned in 2008.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this painting is the surrender of the British army at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, which ended the last major campaign of the Revolutionary War. The blue sky filled with dark clouds and the broken cannon suggest the battles that led to this event. In early September, entrenched with a force of 7,000 men, Cornwallis had hoped for rescue from the sea, but the British vessels were repelled by a French fleet. Within weeks General Washington had deployed a much larger army, and his artillery bombarded the British positions in early October. After American and French troops overran two British strongholds, Cornwallis surrendered on October 19.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the scene, American General Benjamin Lincoln appears mounted on a white horse. He extends his right hand toward the sword carried by the surrendering British officer, who heads the long line of troops that extends into the background. To the left, French officers appear standing and mounted beneath the white banner of the royal Bourbon family. On the right are American officers beneath the Stars and Stripes; among them are the Marquis de Lafayette and Colonel Jonathan Trumbull, the brother of the painter. General George Washington, riding a brown horse, stayed in the background because Lord Cornwallis himself was not present for the surrender."

        "description": "The portrait [i]Lady with an ermine[/i] (1489-1490) by Leonardo Da Vinci depicts Cecilia Gallerani, the teenage mistress of Ludovico Sforza, the regent and later the Duke of Milan. While some scholars doubted this identification, ample evidence affirms Cecilia Gallerani is the subject of [i]Lady with an ermine[/i]. The earliest mention of the portrait appears in a sonnet by court poet Bernardo Bellincioni, in which he notes that it seems as if Cecilia is listening to an unseen speaker. Further confirmation exists in a correspondence between Cecilia and Isabella d\u2019Este, the marquise of Mantua. In her letter, the marquise asks Cecilia to send her the portrait so she can compare Leonardo\u2019s work to that of another master, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini]Giovanni Bellini[/url]. Most importantly, the correspondence reveals that although Ludovico commissioned the painting, Cecilia owned it.\n\nIt is possible that because Cecilia was not of the highest rank, Leonardo allowed himself the freedom to break away from local conventions of portraiture. Most notably, he abandoned the local tradition of the profile portrait in favor of a three quarter view of the subject. Through the innovative pose Leonardo provoked the viewer\u2019s curiosity and engaged them with the sitter of the portrait: she seems to be attentively gazing at something or someone out of view at the right side of the picture. The lady holds the ermine with her left hand, while her right hand elegantly caresses the animal\u2019s shoulder. The suggestive hand gesture recurs in Leonardo\u2019s later composition [i]Leda and the Swan[/i]  - even though the oil painting did not survive, the overall composition is known from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/leda-and-the-swan-1506]drawings[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/il-sodoma/leda-and-the-swan-copy-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1515]oil copies[/url] made after Leonardo\u2019s painting. In [i]Lady with an ermine[/i], Leonardo also demonstrated tremendous skill in his treatment of contrasting textures: the smooth skin next to the ermine\u2019s fur, the carved jet-black beads against the chest and the intricately woven dress, the embroidered garment besides the smooth plain silk.\n\nOne of the key elements of the painting is the lively creature Cecilia holds in her arms. In fact, the symbolism of the ermine provides further evidence supporting the identification of Cecilia as the sitter. The ermine is a symbol of moderation and purity, and as such, its inclusion is appropriate for a portrait of a mistress of a Renaissance duke. Scholars also pointed to the fact that the Greek word for ermine is [i]gal\u00e9[/i], thus it is a play on the Cecelia\u2019s surname (Gallerani). Additionally, some have suggested that the ermine is an emblem associated to Ludovico, thus the ermine can be interpreted as an allusion to Cecilia\u2019s lover.\n\n[i]Lady with an ermine[/i] was purchased in Italy around 1800 by the Polish Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski. He brought the painting to Poland, where he presented it to his mother, the Princess Izabella. The painting was incorporated into the family collection in Pu\u0142awy, the museum founded by Princess Izabella in 1796. Today, it is the highlight of the collection at the Czartoryski Museum in Krak\u00f3w, and is considered one of Poland\u2019s national treasures."

It was probably executed between 1435 and 1449 and is also known as Portrait of a Princess of the House of Este. It is firmly attributed to Pisanello on stylistic grounds and because he stayed in Ferrara in the period, where he also finished a portrait and a celebrative medal of Marquis Leonello d'Este. The princess is shown in profile against a background of numerous butterflies and columbine flowers. The butterfly near the princess' brow is a symbol of the soul. The painting is currently housed and exhibited in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris, France."

        "description": "The mural [i]Achelous and Hercules[/i] (1947) was commissioned in 1946 for display at the Harzfeld\u2019s department store in Kansas City. For the mural, Benton chose a theme from Greek mythology, the story of Achelous and Hercules, which he found in Bulfinch\u2019s [i]Mythology[/i] \u2013 a book that recounted classical myths and stories from different eras. The myth explains the origins of agriculture: Achelous, the river God took the form of an angry bull during flood season and traveled the earth tearing new channels with his horns. Hercules defeated Achelous by tearing off one his horns, and then the horn transformed into nature\u2019s cornucopia \u2013 a symbol of abundance and nourishment in classical antiquity. The myth explains how the development of agriculture depends on the taming of rivers that overflow their banks and destroy croplands.\n\nIn the mural, Benton reimagined the Greek myth in the setting of the American Midwest. Hercules is depicted as a midwestern cowboy, and the fruit and vegetables spilling from the cornucopia are products that farmers grow in the area. The mural is populated with figures that represent the rural midwestern community. To distinguish this from a simple midwestern farm scene, Benton adds the allegorical figure of Victory sitting on the cornucopia: she is offering a laurel lead and holding a fluttering red drape. Through the story of Achelous and Hercules, Benton addressed both regional and national issues. For Benton, the myth was relevant to the local environment and the Army Corps of Engineers' efforts to control the Missouri River. The artist wrote: \u201cThe story is thus applicable to our own land. It's our Missouri River, which yet needs the attention of a Hercules\u201d. The mural celebrates the abundance and richness of the Midwest and American agriculture. This was a timely subject, as it coincided with the Marshall Plan, the initiative of President Henry Truman that provided aid and economic assistance to countries in Western Europe, helping to rebuild their economies after World War II.\n\nBenton reinterpreted the myth in a way that reflected contemporary American life. In a way, the mural was also symbolic of the artist\u2019s professional situation. Benton painted the mural at a time when he was alienated from the East Coast art scene: he was labeled by critics as a loud, gawky, and provincial artist. In the mural, Benton rebuffs his critics: he promotes his figurative style, emphasizing his bold use of color and the vitality of his athletic figures.  [i]Achelous and Hercules[/i] stands in contrast with the art that was developing in New York in the 1940s. The dominant trend of the decade was [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism]Abstract Expressionism[/url], an artistic movement promoted by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko]Mark Rothko[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/adolph-gottlieb]Adolph Gottlieb[/url], and Benton\u2019s former student [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jackson-pollock]Jackson Pollock[/url]. Benton\u2019s mural not only celebrates the abundance of midwestern agriculture, but also the richness of midwestern art.\n\nIn 1947 [i]Achelous and Hercules[/i] was hung in Harzfeld\u2019s department store in Kansas City. It was purchased by the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 1985 and is now exhibited on the 2nd floor of the North Wing of the Museum."

The artist used a traditional format, his pose is simple but dignified, and the painting has an air of respectability. It stands in contrast to his other self-portrait, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/self-portrait-with-a-lute][i]Self-portrait with a lute[/i][/url] (ca. 1663-1665), where the artist plays the role of a musician or a theatre actor. Steen also inserted himself in many of his group [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]genre painting[/url]s, that depicted common people engaged in everyday activities. In [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/merry-company-on-a-terrace-1675][i]Merry Company on a Terrace[/i][/url] (ca. 1673-1675), he assumes the role of the inebriated innkeeper, and in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/doctor-s-visit-1665][i]Doctor\u2019s Visit[/i][/url] (ca.1663-1665), he plays the role of the joker, grinning mischievously and making a suggestive gesture. Steen was known as a comic painter, and in his art he emphasized the theatrical and flamboyant aspect of his persona. However, it would be misleading to conflate these portrayals with Steen\u2019s personality and his identity as an artist. [i]Self-portrait[/i] shows a more formal and serious side, that gives a fuller perspective on Steen as an artist.\n\nSteen\u2019s painting is a type of self-portrait associated with the tradition of artistic emulation. Specifically, the Dutch self-portrait was advanced by the artworks of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url], who also built upon and was inspired by portraits of Italian masters such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]. Rembrandt\u2019s works, such as the etching [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/self-portrait-leaning-on-a-stone-sill-1639][i]Self-portrait leaning on a stone sill[/i][/url] (1639) and the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/self-portrait-1640][i]Self Portrait[/i][/url] (1640), became quintessential models for artworks of self-portraiture. By emulating and imitating this type of self-portrait, artists had an opportunity to express their knowledge and virtuosity, pushing themselves to surpass the given model and outperform their predecessors. Rembrandt inspired artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ferdinand-bol]Ferdinand Bol[/url] in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ferdinand-bol/self-portrait-1669][i]Self Portrait[/i][/url] (ca. 1669) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-van-mieris-the-elder]Frans van Mieris the Elder[/url] in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-van-mieris-the-elder/self-portrait-aged-32-1667][i]Self-Portrait as a Painter[/i][/url] (1667).\n\nSteen adopted this model, but at the same time transformed it in a way that expressed his artistic point of view. In his self-portrait, Steen chose to adorn a contemporary black garment, similar to his attire in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/dissolute-household-1664][i]Dissolute Household[/i][/url] (1661-1664) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/the-way-you-hear-it-1665][i]The way you hear it[/i][/url] (ca. 1663-1665). This contrasts Rembrandt\u2019s choice of costume that was inspired by antiquity. Similarly, Steen rejected the architectural elements associated with antiquity, like the Italian inspired stone ledge in Rembrandt\u2019s [i]Self-portrait leaning on a stone sill[/i] or the cupid statue in Bol\u2019s [i]Self Portrait[/i]. The allusions to antiquity were used to bolster the artist\u2019s status, by connecting their self-portraits to the grand tradition of painting and art. In contrast, Steen posed in front of a landscape while leaning on a simple chair.\n\nA technological study of the painting revealed that Steen originally painted himself with a broader smile, but repainted his face afterwards. In the end, the artist leaves only a hint of a smile and a certain cunningness in his glare. This indicates that the artist opted to conform to conventions of decorum, because a broad smile would be considered inappropriate for a formal portrait. Steen\u2019s [i]Self-portrait[/i] demonstrates a more casual, modest and local approach to self-portraiture. Steen chose not to place himself in the context of the grand tradition of art history; he rather presented himself in contemporary clothing as a man of his time."

        "description": "[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]Self-portraits[/url] are an important part of Odd Nerdrum\u2019s body of work. In [i]Second Birth[/i] (2004), Nerdrum made a bold statement: the artist chose to portray himself as a prophet or a Messiah figure. Prophets are important figures in Judeo-Christian theology: they serve as vessels that transmit God\u2019s word to the masses. While prophets enjoy a special status and a unique relationship with God, they are often burdened and misunderstood figures. Their calling forces them to tell harsh truths, and as a result they are often ridiculed and even persecuted. By painting himself in such a way, Nerdrum compares the experience of an artist to that of a prophet, thus commenting on the artist\u2019s role and status. Like the prophet, the artist can share spiritual truths with the audience through his work.   \n\nNerdrum built upon the Western tradition of the genre of self-portraiture, particularly the work of one of his idols, the Dutch Master, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url]. In [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/frontal-self-portrait-1998][i]Frontal Self Portrait[/i][/url] (1998) Nerdrum even presents himself as reincarnation of Rembrandt. He modeled himself in the image of the Dutch master alluding to Rembrandt\u2019s works such as [[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/self-portrait-in-at-the-age-of-63-1669]i]Self Portrait at the Age of 63[/i][/url] (1669) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/self-portrait-as-the-apostle-paul-1661][i]Self Portrait as the Apostle Paul[/i][/url] (1661). Nerdrum expressed his personal and artistic identity, he sees himself as an old master and a reviver of the art of painting. This type of grand comparison is not unusual for Nerdrum. In another self-portrait, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/self-portrait-as-the-prophet-of-painting][i]The Savior of Painting[/i][/url] (1997), he is portrayed barefoot in a golden robe holding a brush and palette. The historical costume once again evokes images of European master painters. Like the title indicates, Nerdrum, who faithfully follows the traditions of European painting, announces himself as the savior of the medium. \n\nIn [i]Second Birth[/i] the artist takes this concept a step further: he is depicted rising from the ground, and as the title indicates he is being reborn. This is a clear reference to the resurrection of Christ, and the artist even adorns a crown of thorns like Christ on the cross. Like Christ, the artist is reborn through pain and suffering. In [i]Second Birth[/i], Nerdrum placed greater emphasis on emotional and spiritual suffering rather than on physical suffering. The realistic depictions of physical suffering are characteristic of Nerdrum\u2019s earlier works like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/hepatitis][i]Hepatitis[/i][/url] (1996-1997). The painting shows a man twisting in agony, who seems to be taking a deep breath as he finds the strength to raise himself up. The depiction in [i]Second Birth[/i] is quite different: the artist is buried in soil with his arms bound in the ground, but his body is languid and his expression is calm. Nerdrum\u2019s spirit is resurrected: his second birth is not physical, it is emotional and spiritual. Another important element in [i]Second Birth[/i] is the earth itself. In his painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/buried-alive][i]Buried Alive[/i][/url] (1995-1996), the ground signifies a place of trauma: it functions both as a crime scene and a weapon. In [i]Second Birth[/i], the earth can also be interpreted as a place of a psychological trauma. However, in this case, the artist rises from the ground and from this place of trauma - he is reborn."

        "description": "West's final significant piece, Death on a Pale Horse, is a dynamic and violent scene, which contrasts the measured subjects of his previous works. Completed three years prior to his death, the painting's vastness, over twenty-five feet wide and fourteen-feet high, emphasizes its subject matter's power. Death, descending on earth on a white horse with clenched fists holding lightning bolts, is surrounded by dragon-like creatures with fiery eyes, leaving carnage beneath his horse's hooves. The spiraling composition also features cowering strong men, a woman, and a baby lying dead, with ghostly figures floating around the canvas. West's classical dress and armor, influenced by Peter Paul Rubens and Greek and Roman roots, highlight his emphasis on emotion rather than coherent storytelling. The painting is an important precursor to artists such as Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, according to art historian Jules Prown. Art critic Thomas Hine remarked in 2018 that the painting is \"energetic and weird and barely coherent,\" besotted with apocalypse, and a wide-screen search for a cosmic conclusion, making West possibly the first American artist."

        "description": "[i]Iron Law[/i] (1983-1984) is considered a seminal painting in Odd Nerdrum\u2019s body of work because it signifies a shift in his artistic direction and a departure from the art he produced in earlier phases of his career. Some of Nerdrum\u2019s early paintings (1968-1983), such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/liberation-1974][i]Liberation[/i][/url] (1974) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/the-murder-of-andreas-baader-1978][i]The Murder of Andreas Baader[/i][/url] (1977-1978) were characterized by his interest in everyday realism and left wing politics. These early paintings depicted a post Christian world, which in many ways reflected modern Scandinavian societies. Paintings like [i]Iron Law[/i] are situated in a different reality: the artist imagined Scandinavia\u2019s pre-Christian pagan past, a world of Norse saga and myth.\n\n[i]Iron Law[/i] depicts a barren landscape with a seascape in the distance. The painting shows a world of masters and slaves: one man clutches his head and bows in submission while the other is about to strike him with a rod. In the distance, there is a third figure that in his posture can be associated with well-known scenes of Adam being banished from the gates of Paradise. The painting shows the archetypal moment, which the 19th century philosopher Hegel identified in his [i]The Phenomenology of Spirit[/i] as the moment that begins human history. According to Hegel, this moment established the master-slave dialectic: the first encounter between the two men leads to a deadly struggle, and one eventually dominates the other, thereby establishing the master-slave relationship. In Hegelian thought this is not a state of happiness - the slave will eventually overpower the master because of his skills and knowledge, making the master reliant on his labor. While Hegel viewed this reversal positively, Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy viewed this as collapse and a situation that creates a struggle between conflicting moralities: the slave morality and the master morality. In his paintings Nerdrum engages with these philosophical concepts, and specifically in [i]Iron Law[/i], he depicts the world in which Nietzsche\u2019s idea of master morality rules. From the master\u2019s perspective qualities of nobility, power and strength are considered \u2018good\u2019, while characteristics of weakness and submissiveness are \u2018bad\u2019. [i]Iron Law[/i] portrays the essence of this system, a primordial scene where power and strength are explicitly asserted. According to Nerdrum, these are the true values of humanity: the modern world does not negate them, it only creates tactics that conceal its aggressive ways. Nerdrum stated: [i]\u201cThe most important thing is to make people see that everything we now look upon as qualities are negatives of the true qualities.\u201d[/i] The figures in [i]Iron Law[/i] exists in an elementary state, confronted directly with the realities of life and death. Nerdrum attempts to reawaken the truth of this ancient world that is obscured by the daily comforts of the modern world.\n\nIn other paintings from this period, Nerdrum created numerous scenes that imagine this ancient world. These paintings continued his exploration of themes of life and death. Paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/twin-mother-by-the-sea-1999][i]Twin Mother by the Sea[/i][/url] (1999) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/woman-with-milk][i]Woman with Milk[/i][/url] (1988-1993) deal with motifs of fertility and birth. Other paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/buried-alive][i]Buried Alive[/i][/url] (1995-1996) relate more closely to death and violence seen in [i]Iron Law[/i]."

        "description": "One of the most famous paintings in the world, [i]The Last Supper[/i] by Leonardo da Vinci was painted in the late 15th century for the Dominican monastery Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. The wall painting was commissioned by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, who was Leonardo\u2019s patron during his first extended stay in Milan.\n\nThe composition of [i]The Last Supper[/i] is neatly arranged - Jesus is positioned in the center of a long table and the Apostles are to his left and right. The room is relatively plain: dark tapestries cover the walls on either side, while three windows on the back wall reveal a landscape that recalls the countryside of Milan. Leonardo created the illusion of space by using linear perspective \u2013 a technique in which all parallel lines in the painting converge in a single vanishing point. In [i]The Last Supper[/i], the single vanishing point, at Jesus\u2019s right temple, draws the viewer\u2019s attention to the main subject in the foreground. Jesus adorns the traditional blue and red robes, but he has no halo. Some scholars have suggested that Leonardo alludes to the halo through the shining light from the window behind Jesus, or the pediment above the window. Others however believed that the absence of the halo signifies the fact that Jesus is a still human being, who, as such, will suffer through the pain and death of the Passion.\n\nIn his depiction of [i]The Last Supper[/i], Leonardo chose to present the scene as a depiction of successive moments: Jesus has declared to the Apostles that one of them will betray him, and the Apostles react to his announcement. The serene expression and posture of Christ stands in contrast to the confused and agitated state of the Apostles. Their reactions and postures vary, adding interest and drama to the composition: on Christ\u2019s left, James the Greater throws his arms out in anger, Thomas gestures to the sky as if to question God\u2019s plan, and Phillip points towards himself wondering could he be the traitor. Some reactions hold additional symbolism: Peter holds a knife behind his back that he will later use to cut off an ear of a soldier attempting to arrest Christ. Judas, who is next to Peter, tightly grips the purse with the reward he received for betraying Jesus with one hand, while he reaches toward a dish with the other. Judas and Jesus reach for the same dish, a reference to the biblical quote: \u201c[i]The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me[/i]\u201d (Matthew 26:23).\n\nWhen painting [i]The Last Supper[/i] Leonardo used an experimental technique, working with tempera and oil paint. The experimental technique combined with the humidity and the dampness of the location led to the quick deterioration of the painting. Over the centuries, the painting suffered additional damage. Due to its poor condition, the painting underwent a major restoration that began in 1978. The restoration, completed in 1999, proved controversial: many were dissatisfied with the outcome saying that hardly any of Leonardo\u2019s original work is visible. Still, some praised the recovery of many details, like the food on the table and the facial expressions."

The painting was not a smash hit, as it received mixed reviews, ranging from ridicule at the childish naivet\u00e9 of the painting, to the understanding and acclaim at its technical complexity, and with it he received his first recognition as an accomplished artist. Although there are tales (which may have been spread by himself) that Rousseau had studied the flora and fauna of the jungle during his travels in Mexico, he never left France, and learned all he knew of the jungle from botanical gardens, textbooks, and oral accounts.

The massive tree, with its intertwining branches, vines, and protective leaf canopy, suggests an ancient and unspoiled landscape. It is an idyllic locale, where a mirror-like river and the modest waterfall suggest the calm and comforting sounds of nature that reassure The Constant Sky of her way of life. For all the assumptions made during Kane\u2019s time about the Aboriginal people being a \u201cvanishing race,\u201d one wonders if Kane\u2019s image is meant to be an affirmation of the permanence of the Aboriginal presence. Seen from a nineteenth-century perspective, the early morning light in this painting alludes to the future, underscoring the idea of continuity that is implicit in both the woman\u2019s name and the presence of the child.\r\n          Kane may have drawn on several different personal experiences to create this painting; he apparently relied on sketches of landscapes, figures, and cultural objects from different regions and tribes.  Ultimately Kane\u2019s random borrowing from his own field sketches is moot, as his goal was to transcend the particular and capture an essential moral truth. Kane\u2019s Arcadian landscape, framed by a painted, decorative arch of gold, offers a meditation on the ideal communion between humankind and nature, which at the time was thought to be manifest in the lives of the Aboriginal people."

Like many of her earliest subjects, it derived from popular illustration\u2014in this case, a well-known Currier & Ives lithograph. Although Moses did at the very start of her career sometimes copy compositions verbatim, she never tried to duplicate this Currier & Ives print. Rather, from the start she freely combined elements from her primary source with vignettes from other sources and from her own imagination. Certain stock images do tend to recur in the \"Sugaring Off\" paintings, however, among them the burning cauldron, the mother pouring maple sugar on the snow (where it would harden into instant candy), the men with buckets, and the little \"sugar house.\"\r\nSugaring Off dates from 1943, at the height of Grandma Moses' first truly mature style. She had by this point in her career gained formidable mastery of her medium. She was capable of rendering details with pristine clarity and of handling extremely complex compositions. Sugaring Off is notable for its vast assortment of disparate activities, arrayed in a preternaturally broad landscape. This opening up of the landscape into an almost square, quiltlike panoply of detail is one of the hallmarks of the \"Grandma Moses style.\" As she matured further, however, Moses would revert to narrower horizontals, which required greater compression of detail."

Figures in Middle Eastern dress appear in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] works, and the opulent eroticism of harem scenes appealed to the French [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/rococo]Rococo[/url] aesthetic. Until this point, however, Europeans had minimal contact with the East, usually through trade and intermittent military campaigns. In 1798, a French army led by General Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt and occupied the country until 1801. The European presence in Egypt attracted Western travelers to the Near and Middle East and enhanced connection between two worlds.\n\nThroughout his career, G\u00e9ricault created many fine portraits. The subject of [i]Head of an Oriental man[/i] was a real man, a domestic servant of G\u00e9ricault, a Tunisian Arab named Mustafa Sussen. Apparently, he was a survivor of a shipwreck. G\u00e9ricault had found him in a Paris street and brought home as a model and companion. It is probably his features, dark eyes sad beneath his turban, that are depicted in several late studies of a Turk that strike the viewer as warmly individualized portraits. Mustafa posed as a model for other painters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet]Anne-Louis Girodet[/url] ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet/mustapha-1819][i]Mustapha[/i][/url], 1819) or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/horace-vernet]Horace Vernet[/url] ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/horace-vernet/a-man-in-oriental-costume-1818][i]A Man in Oriental Costume[/i][/url], 1818). \n\nA vital aspect of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism]Romantic[/url] movement was the full embrace of exotic \"oriental\" themes in art. Like many artists of the period, G\u00e9ricault was interested in the world beyond Western Europe. The artist desired to visit the Holy Land so that he could experience the Middle East in all its sounds, sights, and interactions. However, he never managed to travel there and therefore relied on books he read, works with related subjects he collected, and most importantly, his servant Mustapha. \n\nG\u00e9ricault led the way for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/orientalism]Orientalist[/url] artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix]Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix[/url], L\u00e9on Cognet, and Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin, whose travels in Northern Africa formed an essential part of their inspiration."

She became active as a portrait painter and exhibited pictures in Philadelphia and other art societies between 1825 and 1869. Her son became a well-known organist in Philadelphia. Although this portrait is dated \"1840. Jan.,\" according to a register kept by Sully it was begun on April 13, 1839, and finished on December 31. The register also records the painting of a smaller replica in 1866. The composition may be linked to Sir Thomas Lawrence's Countess Grey and Her Daughters (private collection). It makes use of a full range of iconographic elements, such as the rendition of the Salpion Krater. As used here, its scene of Dionysos brought by Hermes to be nurtured by the nymphs serves to emphasize the tender closeness of mother and son.

The artist\u2019s \u201cOwl\u201d was flagged as part of the \u201cBlack Painting Exhibition\u201d held at China\u2019s National Art Gallery in Beijing, as an example of being counterrevolutionary. The Gang of Four interpreted the winking owl as the artist\u2019s portrayal of public officials turning a blind eye to wrong doings. For this, Huang Yongyu was harshly reprimanded for three and a half years laboring at a reform camp.\r\n\r\nJoan Lebold Cohen, art historian, photographer and curator, and associate of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard, comments in her book, The New Chinese Painting 1949-1986 (1987), that: \u201c[o]bviously, the verisimilitude to nature was ignored \u2013 owls often close one eye \u2013 but the entire Black Paintings concept was like Alice in Wonderland nonsense.\u201d Pg. 125\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Eugene Wang, assistant art professor at Harvard University, wrote in his publication, The Winking Owl: Visual Effect and Its Art Historical Thick Description\u201d Critical Inquiry 26 (Spring 2000), \u201cThere is a consensus now that the painter was a victim more sinned against than sinning, that he became an innocent pawn in a game of high-level power politics, and that the inquisition to which the painter and his painting were subjected made a travesty of art criticism. It is not clear, however, how innocent the painting was. Does the painting contain the message it was charged with?\u201d Pg. 438\r\n\r\nMr. Wang does ask an interesting question though. While clearly overblown, was the artist in fact, entirely innocent of the charges? According to Laing\u2019s publication, The Winking Owl: Art in the People\u2019s Republic of China (1988), the author wrote: \u201cHuang Yongyu had earlier (1962) gotten into trouble for his \u201ccounterrevolutionary\u201d Animal Crackers poems in which he used animals to lampoon political figures.\u201d Pg. 86 "

By the time he painted this work, he was the most famous artist in Britain and President of the Royal Academy of Arts. In his lectures at the Academy, Reynolds elaborated a theory of art based around the need for modern British artists to copy the Old Masters. In this picture, his costume, his pose, and the dramatic contrasts of light and dark all refer to the work of Rembrandt. Even the shape of his face is made to resemble the Dutch artist's distinctive, jowly features."

The model on his canvas is dressed in a rutsa - a dressing gown decorated with embroidery.\n\n\"Mordovian Girl\" was written during Kharlamov's foreign retirement trip after graduating from the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts with a large gold medal. Shown in 1873 at the World Exhibition in Vienna, \"Mordovian Girl\" became one of the paintings for which the artist received a bronze medal. The assessment of this work by contemporaries was ambiguous. The critic Stasov, in his review of the Vienna World's Fair, called it \"strongly written.\" Kramskoy judged more harshly: \u201cWhen Bogolyubov pointed at her with particular chic, then, a sinful man, I even admired for five minutes, then, looking around and moving from one piece of painting to another, I had to confess that all this was invented, false, wrong, and in the end he rejected. \" Note that the painting was acquired by Bogolyubov no later than 1874 (possibly immediately after the World Exhibition).\n\nKharlamov is often called a salon artist. One of the journalists of that era wrote that his specialty was \"children's heads and scenes from children's life.\" This kind of work was typical of salon art. In the \"heads\" the painter was primarily guided by the tastes of his customers. His \"heads\", designed to decorate a wealthy home, were as pleasant as the salon painting itself.\n\nIn Kharlamov's \"Mordovian Girl\", various stylistic trends of the second half of the 19th century are intertwined. It contains not only echoes of romanticism and sentimentalism - it is no coincidence that contemporaries saw in his \u201cheads\u201d both the influence of the French artist of the 18th century Greuze, and the features of realism (in the choice of theme and in the attraction to psychologism) and eclecticism. \"Mordovka\", like many \"heads\" of Kharlamov of the 1870s, evokes associations with the works of the caravaggists who worked in Italy in the 17th century in the genre of bamboccianti. They often painted scenes from folk life, where commoners, merchants, beggars, gypsies, etc. appeared. But Kharlamov does not address such motives, he only borrows the type and manner of writing. The color scheme of the picture is in brown tones. Here we can talk about the caravaggist style of tenebroso with its sharp chiaroscuro.\n\nNote that the \"heads\" make up most of Kharlamov's creative heritage. Undoubtedly, commercial success played an important role in their creation. But unlike most of Kharlamov's \"heads\" in \"Mordovian Girl\" there is almost no touch of sweetness. Undoubtedly, this is one of the best works of Kharlamov. \n\n[b]Details[/b]\n\n- In this work, the artist is ethnographically accurate in conveying the Erzya Mordovian costume. The model on his canvas is dressed in a rutsa - a dressing gown, \n\n- The painter seeks to convey the state of mind of the model: hidden sadness and unaccountable melancholy are read in the eyes of the girl. Intense contrast of light \n\n- Compared to the girl's face, her outfit is written more freely. Small strokes are perceived as interspersed with jewelry in a painting fabric \n\n\nPlease Note: Text not written by me but translated from: https://artefact.app/ru/subject/a-a-harlamov-mordovskaya-devushka -"

In March 1902 the dealer William Macbeth encouraged him to paint New York cityscapes for inclusion in a solo exhibition scheduled for the following month. Henri hoped to produce a painting for the occasion that would achieve a degree of critical acclaim comparable to that of La Neige (1899, Louvre, Paris), a snowy view of the rue de S\u00e8vres in Paris that had been purchased for the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in 1899. While a buyer was found for Snow in New York, only one other work sold, prompting Henri to turn his attention primarily to portraiture."

But death was not ominous for van Gogh. \"Looking at the stars always makes me dream,\" he said, \"Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star.\"\r\nThe artist wrote of his experience to his brother Theo: \"This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big.\" This morning star, or Venus, may be the large white star just left of center in The Starry Night. The hamlet, on the other hand, is invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands. The painting, like its daytime companion, The Olive Trees, is rooted in imagination and memory. Leaving behind the Impressionist doctrine of truth to nature in favor of restless feeling and intense color, as in this highly charged picture, van Gogh made his work a touchstone for all subsequent Expressionist painting."

Frequently referenced in popular culture, the small canvas (24x33 cm) is sometimes known as \u201cMelting Clocks\u201d, \u201cThe Soft Watches\u201d and \u201cThe Melting Watches\u201d. The painting depicts a dreamworld in which common objects are deformed and displayed in a bizarre and irrational way: watches, solid and hard objects appear to be inexplicably limp and melting in the desolate landscape. Dal\u00ed paints his fantastical vision in a meticulous and realistic manner: he effortlessly integrates the real and the imaginary in order \u201cto systemize confusion and thus to help discredit completely the world of reality\u201d.\n \nWhen asked about the limp watches, the artist compared their softness to overripe cheese saying that they show \u201cthe camembert of time\u201d. The idea of rot and decay is most evident in the gold watch on the left, which is swarmed by ants. Ants, a common motif in Dal\u00ed\u2019s art are usually linked to decay and death. He set the scene in a desolate landscape that was likely inspired by the landscape of his homeland, the Catalan coast. The influence of the Catalan landscape also appears in another element of the painting: the artist inserts himself into the scene in the form of a strange fleshy creature in the center of the painting. According to Dal\u00ed, the self-portrait was based on a rock formation at Cap de Creus in northeast Catalonia. Some scholars have also drawn a parallel between the self-portrait and a section of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch]Hieronymus Bosch[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/the-garden-of-earthly-delights-1515-7][i]The Garden of Earthly Delights[/i][/url] (1510-1515) \u2013 on the right side of the left panel Bosch depicts rocks, bushes, and small animals that resemble Dal\u00ed\u2019s profile with the prominent nose and long eyelashes. Similar versions of this self-portrait appear in other paintings by Dal\u00ed like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-great-masturbator-1929][i]The Great Masturbator[/i][/url] (1929).\n \nThe melting watch, one of Dal\u00ed\u2019s most powerful and potent motifs, continued to play an important role in his art. Two decades after [i]The Persistence of Memory[/i], Dal\u00ed recreated his famous work in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-disintegration-of-the-persistence-of-memory][i]The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory[/i][/url] (1952-1954). As the title suggests, the painting shows the disintegration of the world depicted in the original painting, reflecting a world changed by the nuclear age. The painting showed Dal\u00ed\u2019s growing interest in quantum physics: he added rectangular blocks that represent \u201cthe atomic power source\u201d and missile-like objects that reference the atomic bomb. In the late stages of his career, Dal\u00ed also produced numerous sculptures of melting watches including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-persistence-of-memory-1980][i]The Persistence of Memory[/i][/url] (ca. 1980), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/profile-of-time-1984][i]Profile of Time[/i][/url] (1977-1984), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/nobility-of-time-1984][i]Nobility of Time[/i][/url] (1977-1984) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/dance-of-time-i-1984][i]Dance of Time I[/i][/url] (1979-1984).\n \n[i]The Persistence of Memory[/i] was first shown in 1932 at the [i]Julien Levy Gallery[/i] in New York.

        "description": "The painting [i]Snow White[/i] (1997) by Mark Ryden is an early example of his complex use of iconography, a key characteristic of his art. The painting was featured in Ryden\u2019s 2004 exhibition titled \u201c[i]Wondertoonel[/i]\u201d. The exhibition title was borrowed from the 1706 book [i]Wondertoonel der Nature[/i], that showcased the \u2018cabinet of curiosities\u2019 of Dutch merchant Levin Vincent. For Ryden, his personal cabinet of curiosities is represented in his art through the odd and unique objects that populate his paintings. The artist seeks out inspiration from different sources: museums, popular culture and his own collection of objects. Ryden\u2019s studio is filled with various objects he collected at flea markets, old books, photographs, toys and religious statues. In particular, the artist is drawn to memories and objects that relate to his childhood, which can explain his choice of subject for [i]Snow White[/i]. In the painting, [i]Snow White[/i] is in a surreal environment that weaves together different symbols, creating a kind of personal cabinet of curiosities.\n\nRyden\u2019s [i]Snow White[/i] resembles the Snow White from the Disney animated movie, [i]Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs[/i] produced in 1937. Based on the 19th century fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, it was the first full-length animated movie and it remains one of the most influential children movies ever made. Ryden plays with Snow White\u2019s image in popular culture: Snow White \u2018the fairest of them all\u2026 with hair as black as ebony, skin as white as snow, and lips as red as a rose\u2019 is a symbol of purity, beauty and goodness. Ryden subverts this image by presenting Snow White in the nude reclining on a couch. Several symbols ironically allude to Snow White\u2019s purity, the rose and lily and even a small statuette of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Curator Debra J. Byrne suggests that the bottle of wine next to Snow White references the biblical [i]Luke 22:13[/i]: the chapter deals with Judas betraying Jesus for gold. This could be interpreted as a critique of the commercialized image of Snow White.\n  \nThe pose and composition reference the two masterpieces by 19th century painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]\u00c9douard Manet[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863][i]Olympia[/i][/url] (1863) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/the-luncheon-on-the-grass-1863][i]The Luncheon on the Grass[/i][/url] (1863). Both paintings by Manet caused an uproar when they were first shown in Paris. The paintings were labeled \u2018vulgar\u2019 and \u2018immoral\u2019 for their sexual overtones and suggestions of indecent behavior. In [i]Snow White[/i], Ryden added a slab of meat and primordial landscape making carnal and sensual qualities of his Snow White more explicit. Meat is a recurring theme in Ryden\u2019s art, and for the artist \u2018the consumption of animal flesh is a natural primal instinct, just like sex and making paintings\u2019. Perhaps this is a critique of the media sexualizing young girls and our collective consumption of such content. Snow White covers her genitalia with a book with the image of the Buddha. This addition of religious symbols once again brings into question the meaning of [i]Snow White[/i] - is this image holy or blasphemous? Ryden leaves this open to interpretation, hinting at multiple possibilities with a wide range of symbols from a variety of sources: religious iconography, art history and popular culture."

Painted near the village of Zaandam, the Achterzaan river occupies the foreground of the painting while windmills and industrial buildings can be seen in the distant background. The water reflects the multi-colored houses and willow trees that line the river bank as well as a white sail boat that floats along the water. A woman dressed in a white diaphanous gown stands beneath a willow tree on the left, gazing by the water. \r\n\r\nEmploying a distinctly blonde color palette reminiscent of that used by landscape painter Corot, Monet renders this scene with attention to atmospheric detail and palpable light. This painting also evokes a sense of leisure and pastoral beauty typical of Dutch seventeenth century paintings that Monet would have seen during his stay in Holland. The artist\u2019s color palette, portrayal of leisurely pursuits, and increasing attention to the surface of the canvas\u2014all practices that Monet explored during his stay in Holland\u2014were significant and influential in the development of his increasingly modern approach to painting.\r\n\r\nMonet postdated this work, marking the canvas in his studio in the year after it was painted. The fact that Monet held on to the canvas for many years after he completed it contributes to the pristine condition of the unlined, unvarnished painting."

Natural materials are focal in Sliman Mansour\u2019s recent artworks. The combination of mud and acrylic on wood reflects the tension between the rough cracks of mud which is dominant, in contrast to adjacent areas of smoothly painted acrylic colors. Mansour\u2019s works represent the stalemate situation in the Palestinian current reality and the subsequent changes that permeate the nature of Palestinians as people."

        "description": "[i]The Lady of Shalott[/i] (1888), one of John William Waterhouse's best-known paintings, illustrates the tragic conclusion of Alfred Tennyson\u2019s 1832 poem [i]The Lady of Shallot[/i]. Tennyson\u2019s poem retells a medieval Arthurian legend about Elaine of Astolat, who died of unrequited love for Sir Lancelot. According to the legend, she was cursed in a tower near King Arthur\u2019s Camelot. In Tennyson\u2019s poem, the Lady of Shalott\u2019s suffers from a curse that forbids her from leaving her tower: she sits in the tower and weaves, only allowed to look upon reality through a mirror. Defying her curse, she looks out the window and heads in a small boat to Camelot. Punished for breaking the curse, she dies before reaching her destination. Waterhouse depicts the Lady of Shalott in her final moments, as she lets go of the boat\u2019s chain: her mouth is parted as she sings \u2018her last song\u2019. The tapestry she wove during her confinement is draped over the boat. The artist hints at her near demise: in front of her is a crucifix and next to her are three candles, two of them blown-out. Candles were often used to symbolized life, and the two blown-out candles signify that her life will end soon.\n\nTennyson\u2019s poem was very popular among Pre-Raphaelite painters and poets, inspiring many works, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-atkinson-grimshaw/the-lady-of-shalott-1878][i]The Lady of Shalott[/i][/url] (1878) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-atkinson-grimshaw]John Atkinson Grimshaw[/url],  [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/the-lady-of-shalott-moxon-tennyson-1857][i]The Lady of Shalott[/i][/url] (1857) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti]Dante Gabriel Rossetti[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt/the-lady-of-shalott][i]The Lady of Shalott[/i][/url] (1905) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt]William Holman Hunt[/url]. Waterhouse, who was influenced by the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood]Pre-Raphaelites[/url] in both style and subject matter, was also very fond of the poem. [i]The Lady of Shalott[/i] became one of the artist\u2019s best-known subjects, and he painted the character in two additional versions, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/the-lady-of-shalott-1894][i]The Lady of Shalott Looking at Lancelot[/i] [/url](1894) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/i-am-half-sick-of-shadows-said-the-lady-of-shalott-1915][i]I am Half-Sick of Shadows, said the Lady of Shalott[/i][/url] (1915).\n\n[i]The Lady of Shalott[/i] was created during a brief period in which Waterhouse painted [i]en plein air[/i] \u2013 a French term for painting outdoors. This likely contributed to the naturalistic depiction of the landscape. Even though the setting of the painting is unknown, it was likely painted during one of the artist\u2019s visits to Devon or Somerset. The model was probably the artist\u2019s wife, Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse. Some have suggested that the painting was a tribute to the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais/ophelia][i]Ophelia[/i][/url] (1851-1852) by Pre-Raphaelite [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-everett-millais]John Everett Millais[/url]. The broad impressionist brushstrokes seen in both paintings replaced the precise treatment characteristic of the earlier Pre-Raphaelite work. In Waterhouse\u2019s sketchbook, there were many pencil sketches and studies for this painting, as well as for the later work [i]I am Half-Sick of Shadows, said the Lady of Shalott[/i]. [i]The Lady of Shalott[/i] was donated to the public in 1894 by Sir Henry Tate and was one of the original paintings gifted by Tate. Today it is displayed at the Tate Britain Museum in London."

        "description": "The theme of the Lamentation of Christ is common in medieval and Renaissance art, although this treatment, dating back to a subject known as the Anointing of Christ is unusual for the period. Most Lamentations show much more contact between the mourners and the body. Rich contrasts of light and shadow abound, infused by a profound sense of pathos. The realism and tragedy of the scene are enhanced by the violent perspective, which foreshortens and dramatizes the recumbent figure, stressing the anatomical details: in particular, Christ's thorax. The holes in Christ's hands and feet, as well as the faces of the two mourners, are portrayed without any concession to idealism or rhetoric. The sharply drawn drapery which covers the corpse contributes to the dramatic effect. The composition places the central focus of the image on Christ's genitals - an emphasis often found in figures of Jesus, especially as an infant, in this period, which has been related to a theological emphasis on the Humanity of Jesus by Leo Steinberg and others.\r\nMantegna presented both a harrowing study of a strongly foreshortened cadaver and an intensely poignant depiction of a biblical tragedy. This painting is one of many examples of the artist's mastery of perspective. At first glance, the painting seems to be a strikingly realistic study in foreshortening . However, careful scrutiny reveals that Mantegna reduced the size of the figure's feet, which, as he must have known, would cover much of the body if properly represented"

        "description": "Mackintosh left London in 1923 and settled in the south-west of France until his return to London for medical treatment in 1927. We have no statements from Mackintosh as to his intentions in painting the towns and mountain foothills of the region but it is thought that he went to France after an offer of an exhibition in a London gallery if he could amass forty to fifty suitable works. His choice of France was probably encouraged by the Scottish artist J. D. Fergusson, whom Mackintosh got to know while living in London. Fergusson praised the light and the climate and, not least, the ability to live relatively well and cheaply compared to London, a factor that probably swayed the Mackintoshes, existing then on a much reduced income. \r\nCrichton - a Scottish film-maker who lives in the Roussillon - has proposed a credible chronology and itinerary for Mackintosh's numerous excursions into the mountains from his various bases, sometimes at Collioure, then Ille-sur-T\u00eat and finally at Port Vendres. From these, it seems likely that this painting of the village of Bouletern\u00e8re was made in 1925, along with three or four others which bear some stylistic similarity and whose subjects all lie along the same route from Ille-sur-T\u00eat up into the mountains. \r\nComparing these watercolours with the actual townscapes, we can see that Mackintosh was not seeking verisimilitude. 'Bouletern\u00e8re' is an amalgam of at least two views of the village, giving a relatively bland and unexciting townscape a much more brooding presence. He did a similar thing in his painting of 'Palalda', changing the colours of the roofs to suit the tonal values of his painting and even sticking a cut-out piece of paper over the lower part of the composition to allow him to change the design or correct what he perceived as errors in his drawing. These paintings show little of the life of these small towns which seem deserted. Mackintosh is more concerned with the patterns of the houses and roofs as they pile up on each other against the hillside. Perspective is flattened, even dispensed with altogether, as the shapes come to dominate the design. Harry Jefferson Barnes, a former Director of the Glasgow School of art, speculated that Mackintosh was losing control of one eye, damaged by a childhood bout of rheumatic fever, which could possibly account for the absence of stereoscopic vision in these works. Perhaps, also, Mackintosh was aware of the landscapes of Klimt and Schiele of around 1913 where a similar flattening of perspective produces an emphasis on geometric pattern of roofs, windows and walls. \r\nWhatever the sources and physical reasons for the development of these watercolours, they do not detract from the masterly achievement of this series of late paintings. They point to Mackintosh's exciting future as an artist, sadly brought quickly to an end by his death from cancer in 1928. "

Fierce storm clouds arc rapidly approaching over the mountains, and in the distance the trees have already begun to whip wildly in the wind. The artist's deployment of color to represent these events is extraordinarily acute: The parched yellows of a late summer meadow, the varied greens of the trees, and the shifting colors of the sky before the advancing torrent are all keenly observed.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground, Moses presents the human reaction to the oncoming threat. There is a mad rush to get the hay into the barn and, at middle distance, a black horse bolts in terror.\r\n\r\nThe girl in the yellow dress is frozen in mid-run, while strangely, behind her to the left, two other children seem oblivious to the commotion. The abstract forms used to render all the human and animal activity stand in sharp contrast to the impressionistic interplay of colors in the landscape elements of the composition. This juxtaposition of abstraction and realism was one of the principal cornerstones of the \"Grandma Moses style.\""

Ornamentation on the shrine includes gold- and silver-embossed, fire-gilded figures, filigree panels set with precious and semi-precious stones, intaglios, and cameos, and columns, arches and profiles trimmed with enamels. The images depicted on the shrine include scenes from the history of salvation from the dawning of time to the Last Judgment. Although the shrine was shortened by one axis after being hidden from French revolutionary troops in 1794, it was largely restored to its original shape during the most recent period of restoration, which lasted from 1961 to 1973. The intention in the Middle Ages was that the shrine would be placed in the crossing. Today, however, it rises above the medieval high altar at the back of the inner choir, making this area the main focus of the Gothic cathedral, which was built as a stone reliquary for this precious shrine."

        "description": "One of the most famous paintings by Thomas Gainsborough is the portrait [i]Mr. and Mrs. Andrews[/i] (1750), which the artist painted when he was only 21 years old. The painting depicts the landowner Robert Andrews and his young wife Frances Andrews sitting on a bench in front of an English countryside landscape. The portrait was commissioned in 1750, two years after the couple married in the parish church of All Saints, Sudbury. However, the painting is not a marriage portrait, instead, it likely celebrated the inheritance Andrews received in 1750. Thus, the painting can be considered a \u2018triple\u2019 portrait \u2013 of Mr. Andrews, his wife, and his land. \n\nThe couple is dressed casually, their attire is suited for an informal outing. Mr. Andrews is wearing a baggy shooting jacket with bags of powder and shot hanging from his pocket. He is holding a long-barreled shotgun and his dog is at his feet. Mrs. Andrews wears a simple light blue skirt and jacket, and a pair of casual heels. The portrait can be categorized as a \u2018conversation piece\u2019, a type of group portrait popular in 18th century England. The conversation piece is a kind of informal portrait: it usually depicts a group of family members or friends in a rural or domestic setting.\n\nIn this early masterpiece, Gainsborough prominently features the naturalistic landscapes, that dominates the right side of the canvas. The artist was particularly fond of landscape painting, and in this case, he used the landscape to display his painterly skills. He creates the effect of changing weather, depicting stormy skies with patches of light and shadow that fall over the fields and meadows. This technique was common in Dutch 17th-century landscape painting, which influenced Gainsborough\u2019s style of painting. This relatively small piece (69.8 cm \u00d7 119.4 cm) was typical of Gainsborough\u2019s work in this early period. His later portraits such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/portrait-of-colonel-john-bullock][i]Portrait of Colonel John Bullock[/i][/url] (ca. 1780) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/mrs-richard-brinsley-sheridan-1786][i]Mrs. Richard Brinsley Sheridan[/i][/url] (1785-1787) were much grandeur and painted on larger, close to life-size formats. In these later works, the figure takes center stage, while the landscape in the background becomes more generalized.\n\nIn the painting, Gainsborough left an unpainted patch in Mrs. Andrews's lap. The reason behind this is unknown: some speculate the artist planned to paint a cock pheasant in her lap, which her husband shot while hunting. Others suggest that space was reserved for a baby \u2013 the couple, who had nine children in total, had their first child only in 1751. If this was the intention, the portrait would celebrate Mr. Andrew\u2019s authority as a landowner and husband. Mrs. Andrews died in 1780 at age 48, while her husband remarried and died in 1806 at age 80. \n\nThe portrait was largely unknown to the public until it was displayed in an exhibition in Ipswich in 1927. After that, the painting regularly appeared in exhibitions across Britain and abroad. It remained with the family until 1960 when it was sold by Gerald Willoughbury Andrews (a great-great-great-grandson of the sitters). Today, the painting is in the National Gallery, London."

They are generally considered among his most important achievements, possibly his masterpiece. The subjects are taken from The Book of Revelation. The Last Judgement illustrates the central event of the Book, and is composed from various passages in the narrative. On a throne in the heavens sits God in judgement, surrounded by the four and twenty elders. The four angels have sounded their trumpets after the opening of the Seventh Seal. Below on the right the forces of evil commanded by Satan are defeated; the armies of Gog and Magog tumble into the bottomless pit. To the left on Mount Zion are the good, already in the 'plains of heaven' and awaiting the call to appear before the throne.\r\n\r\nThe principal figures were identified in an engraved key published in 1855 by Leggatt, Haward and Leggatt to accompany the picture. The damned include richly dressed women, notably Herodias's daughter and the whore of Babylon, lawyers and churchmen who have sought only worldly wealth. The saved, at God's right hand, are anonymous figures of virtuous women and innocent children, true lovers, martyrs, philanthropists, and foreground, portraits of the famous. Among the good Martin has included a high percentage of artists and poets, as well as statesmen and philosophers.

        "description": "[i]Bush Sawyers[/i] (1910) is one of several paintings by Australian painter Fredrick McCubbin that depicts the subject of wood sawyers. However, [i]Bush Sawyers[/i] stands out for its dynamic composition: the artist captured the rhythm of the men\u2019s labor by positioning them bent over, facing different directions while working with the two-person saw. Besides, McCubbin painted the giant tree behind the wood sawyers to create a vertical counterpoint to the horizontal movement of the saw.\n\nIn 1901, McCubbin bought a cottage outside of Melbourne on Mount Macedon. He named it \u2018Fountainbleau\u2019 as a homage to the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/barbizon-school]Barbizon School[/url]: the 19th-century school of painting that made significant advances toward [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/realism]Realism[/url]. The art movement took its name from their gathering place, the French village of Barbizon, near the forest of Fontainebleau. In the same spirit, McCubbin painted his early portrayals of wood sawyers at \u2018Fountainbleau\u2019: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederick-mccubbin/the-wood-sawyer-1906][i]The Wood Sawyer[/i][/url] (ca. 1905) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederick-mccubbin/sawing-timber-1907][i]Sawing Timber[/i][/url] (1907). In both artworks, he depicted his eldest son Louis sawing timber in the bush. Like these early versions, [i]Bush Sawyers[/i] was created near McCubbin\u2019s cottage on Mount Macedon. It was a commission for the publishers of [i]Australia Today[/i], the journal of the Commercial Travelers Association of Victoria. The men posing in Bush Sawyers were the brothers James and Patrick \u2018Paddy\u2019 Watson.\n\nScholars have pointed out that McCubbin\u2019s main inspiration for [i]Bush Sawyers[/i] was the painting, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-francois-millet/the-wood-sawyers-1852][i]Wood Sawyers[/i][/url] (1850-1852), by the French painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-francois-millet]Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet[/url], one of the founders of the Barbizon School. McCubbin had a postcard of the painting, and he might have seen it at the Victoria and Albert Museum when he traveled to London in 1907. Millet\u2019s influence is evident in the pose of the wood sawyers, as well as in the color of their clothing. Both painters also covered the faces of the wood sawyers, bringing more attention to their activity and movement. [i]Wood Sawyers[/i] proves more dynamic and engaging than McCubbin\u2019s earlier depictions, something that can be attributed to his familiarity with Millet. Still, unlike Millet, McCubbin emphasized the setting: the wood sawyers blend into the natural environment, and there is a sense of harmony between man and nature. The wood sawyers are illuminated by soft sunlight, and the light shines through the plants creating a shimmering effect.\n\nMcCubbin was part of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/heidelberg-school]Heidelberg School[/url], an Australian art movement that was influenced by naturalist and impressionist ideas, like the practice of painting outdoors in natural light. Painters of the Heidelberg School sought to depict scenes of Australian life and landscape, making the bush a recurring subject. Other painters of the Heidelberg school depicted scenes of woodcutters in the bush: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arthur-streeton]Arthur Streeton[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arthur-streeton/the-selector-s-hut-whelan-on-the-log-1890][i]The selector\u2019s hut (Whelan on the log)[/i][/url] (1890), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-roberts]Tom Roberts[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-roberts/wood-splitters-1886][i]Wood Splitters[/i][/url] (1886) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-conder]Charles Conder[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-conder/under-a-southern-sun-timber-splitters-camp-1890][i]Under a southern sun (Timber splitter\u2019s camp)[/i][/url] (1890). However, in comparison to these paintings, [i]Bush Sawyers[/i] does not portray a story. The chief focus in the painting is the portrayal of masculine labor in the bush."

He became General of the Marines and followed Hawke as the Admiral of the Fleet in 1781 but was prevented by ill-health from taking any active part in affairs.\r\n\r\nThe artist was an important portrait painter of the late eighteenth century, generally ranked third after Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. He was in Paris in 1764 and in 1773 moved to Italy for two years, where he became interested in history paintings in the elevated and \u00e9litist 'Grand Manner'. This developed into improving upon nature and the pursuit of perfect form. At its best his work demonstrated refinement, sensitivity and elegance, although it could also be repetitive and monotonous. As a society painter he typified late-eighteenth-century English artists who, compelled by the conditions of patronage to spend their time in producing portraits, could only aspire to imaginative and ideal painting. By 1780 Romney's portraits, according to Horace Walpole, were 'in great vogue' and he worked in an increasingly neo-classical style. Signed and dated 'G Romney Pinx. 1778'."

Unfortunately, the new Soviet regime, which controlled almost all aspects of social life, was disapproving of Filonov\u2019s analytical style, and forbade the exhibition of his works.

This painting is however dramatically different from his usual work of this period. Instead it follows in the tradition of the landscapes from his later Flemish period, which he occasionally still produced. By comparing A Horse-Drawn Cart with Two Women Travelling down a Flooded Road at the Edge of a Wood to a painting from his Flemish period, such as Peasants Crossing a Stream, which was executed over twenty years earlier, it becomes apparent that Siberechts has adopted the manner and style of the earlier work in the present painting. Both paintings have a stretch of water in the foreground on which Siberechts has indulged a clear interest in the glittering effects of light off the water\u2019s surface. In both works the dominant figures are female, and the inclusion of cattle wading through the water are a prominent feature. The employment of the expanding distant landscape which leads our eye deep into the background of the work, is again a technique apparent in both paintings."

The head of the woman giving birth is shrouded in white cloth while the baby emerging from the womb appears lifeless. At the time that Kahlo painted this work, her mother had just died so it seems reasonable to assume that the shrouded funerary figure is her mother while the baby is Kahlo herself (the title supports this reading). However, Kahlo had also just lost her own child and has said that she is the covered mother figure. The Virgin of Sorrows, who hangs above the bed suggests that this is an image that overflows with maternal pain and suffering. Also though, and revealingly, Kahlo wrote in her diary, next to several small drawings of herself, 'the one who gave birth to herself ... who wrote the most wonderful poem of her life.' Similar to the lithograph [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/frida-and-the-miscarriage-1932][i]Frida and the Miscarriage[/i][/url] (1932), [i]My Birth[/i] represents Kahlo mourning for the loss of a child, but also finding the strength to make powerful art because of such trauma.\n\nThe painting is made in a [i]retablo[/i] (or votive) style (a small traditional Mexican painting derived from Catholic Church art) in which thanks would typically be given to the Madonna beneath the image. Kahlo instead leaves this section blank, as though she finds herself unable to give thanks either for her own birth or for the fact that she is now unable to give birth. The painting seems to bring the message that it is important to acknowledge that birth and death live very closely together. Many believe that [i]My Birth[/i] was heavily inspired by an [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/aztec-art/tlazolteotl-birthing-figure]Aztec-style sculpture of Tlazolteotl[/url], the Goddess of fertility and midwives.\n\nPopstar Madonna collected this painting.

        "description": "The watercolor, [i]A Young Hare[/i] (1502), is one of the most famous examples of D\u00fcrer\u2019s study of nature and animals. The artwork is significant, not only because it demonstrates D\u00fcrer\u2019s supreme craftsmanship, but also because it provides insight into D\u00fcrer\u2019s understanding of the relationship between art and nature. The [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance#!#resultType:masonry]Renaissance[/url] brought about the development of new techniques of representation, such as the study of proportions, perspective and imitation of nature. When visiting Italy in the late 1490s, D\u00fcrer got acquainted with many of these techniques and brought over the newly acquired knowledge back to Germany.  For this reason, much of D\u00fcrer\u2019s artwork from the early 1500s, including [i]A Young Hare[/i], expressed his interest in nature.\n\nThe artist understood the importance of observing nature, stating: \u201cDepart not from Nature\u2026 for Art is rooted in Nature, and whoever can pull it out, has it\u201d. The quote shows D\u00fcrer\u2019s position on the relation between art and nature, and how studying and emulating nature is crucial to artistic creation. Another central principal in D\u00fcrer\u2019s perception of nature was diversity, meaning that every specimen and detail in nature has a distinctive character that should be captured. In other words, D\u00fcrer\u2019s intention was not to create an archetypical form or rely purely on the general characteristics of an animal or plant. D\u00fcrer conceived the hare with exceptional virtuosity, paying attention to the minutest details, such as the hare\u2019s whiskers and eyes. The artist captures its shy and fragile nature, showing great empathy and affection for the small animal. \n\nThe method by which D\u00fcrer managed to reach this level of accuracy is a point of discussion. At this period, methods of animal stuffing were not yet existent, hence D\u00fcrer did not have an option of copying a stuffed model. Likely, D\u00fcrer created preparatory sketches of the animal in the wild, and relied on his memory to complete the watercolor. It is also possible that the artist studied a dead animal or caught a live animal and kept it in his workshop.\n\nIn this case, the subject of the hare is presented in a non religious and non symbolic context. This aligns with D\u00fcrer\u2019s perception of nature and his pure interest in studying nature (animals, landscapes and plants). An interesting aspect of the watercolor is the background. D\u00fcrer chose to present the hare in a white space rather than its natural habitat, like a forest or meadow. The neutral background was used by D\u00fcrer repeatedly, in artworks such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/head-of-a-stag#!#resultType:masonry][i]Head of a Stag[/i][/url] (ca. 1503), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/the-little-owl-1506][i]The Little Owl[/i][/url] (1506) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/wing-of-a-blue-roller-1512][i]Wing of a Blue Roller[/i][/url] (1512). In the case of [i]A Young Hare[/i], some point out D\u00fcrer paints a reflection of a window in the hare\u2019s eye, suggesting that the animal was drawn in the artist\u2019s studio. Nevertheless, this is speculative because this technique was commonly used by D\u00fcrer. Many of D\u00fcrer\u2019s successors and students copied the drawing, however they always placed the animal in a natural environment, such as a meadow or a forest. An example of this is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-hoffmann/a-hare-in-the-forest-after-durer-1585][i]A Hare in the Forest[/i][/url] (ca. 1585) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-hoffmann]Hans Hoffmann[/url], who based this oil painting on D\u00fcrer\u2019s watercolor."

In his autobiography Lefroy mentions how he was equipped for the winter with a \u201cwarm capote of thick white duffle, trimmed with red, and a blue hood,\u201d and another in grey for his companion Corporal Henry.  Lefroy also mentions by name the three-dog team (Papillon, Milord, and Cartouche) that returned him to the Mackenzie River in March 1844 and describes them as having bells and red collars.  Only Lefroy would have known the details that appear in this painting, suggesting that he gave Kane art direction for the essential components of the portrait and that Kane\u2019s painting of Lefroy in a northern landscape was the scientist\u2019s personal commemoration of his achievement. \r\n          This portrait, likely painted sometime between December 1845 and April 1846, gives us a glimpse of how Kane may have used his client connections to advance his career. In 1843 Lefroy had solicited approval from Sir George Simpson, governor of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, for his own trek into the Northwest. In early 1846 Lefroy would in turn write a letter of support to Simpson on Kane\u2019s behalf for the artist\u2019s request for the same privilege. \r\n          When the portrait was first exhibited in 1847 at the Toronto Society of Arts,  its title, \u201cScene in the Northwest\u2014Portrait,\u201d focused on the locale rather than the identity of the person. Featuring the \u201cwhite man\u201d as explorer in Canada\u2019s Northwest, the painting showcases a role that Kane was undertaking at that very moment."

The dark, eerie, primeval bush and the elevated, light-drenched Mount Kosciuszko form two contrasting regions within the composition of the painting. These two areas are visually linked by tall majestic gum trees and a flock of cockatoos. High above, in the distance, hawks glide on alpine currents. The skeletal remains of the towering tree trunks frame a section of the centre foreground where we see Von Neumayer riding his white horse towards his dog, Hector. Several other horses graze quietly in the bush while Von Neumayer\u2019s travelling companions set up camp for the night. The figures are small details in a scene of sweeping natural grandeur.\r\n\r\nWhile von Gu\u00e9rard\u2019s interest in scientific enquiry is evident in the accurately observed details in the landscape, the dramatic contrasts of scale and light reflect Romantic allusions to the divine and poetic in nature."

        "description": "[i]Kitchen table (Still-life with basket)[/i] (1888-1890) is an intricate still life composition painted. It depicts pots, fruits, a basket, and cloth, all assembled on a kitchen table. Every component of the painting is carefully arranged and calculated: the artist pushes the table and cloth close to the viewer and crops them at the bottom of the canvas. The tabletop appears impossibly tilted, and some of the pots seem to be unstable on the table surface. For instance, both the grey pot and the basket have no more surface left on the tabletop. Similarly, the table, the cupboard, and the chair that line up diagonally on the left, all have a distorted sense of perspective. These distortions demonstrate how C\u00e9zanne\u2019s principal concern was geometric form and color, rather than an accurate representation of reality. By painting objects like the grey pot from several viewpoints, simultaneously from above and the front, C\u00e9zanne wanted to represent a more profound truth that could be presented in painting but not in reality.\n\nC\u00e9zanne achieves harmony through the color scheme: the fruits are painted in brilliant tones of red, green, and yellow. He contrasts the warm hues of the wood and the cane with the cooler tones of white, grey, and purple that are visible in the cloth and the ceramic dishes. The artist accentuated the rounded shape of the fruit, by repeating the circular shape in the loop of the grey pot, the basket handle, and in the handle of the coffee pot. There is also repetition in the floral motif in multiple details: the floral decoration on the china coffee jug, the round pot, and the flower painting on the wall.\n\n[i]Kitchen table (Still-life with basket[/i]) is one of many masterful examples of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_still-life,resultType:masonry]C\u00e9zanne\u2019s still lifes[/url], which are a significant portion of his body of work. Throughout his life, he painted nearly 200 still lifes, that mainly focused on simple household objects. In painting one still life after another, C\u00e9zanne continuously explored the relation of the objects in the composition, striving to find harmony and balance in form and color. To achieve this, he rearranged the different objects in his studio into new compositions, painting them at times from multiple viewpoints.\n\nHe was particularly fond of painting fruit and found beauty in their rich colors and basic shape. He explained to a friend: \u201cthey [fruits] love having their portraits done... They exhale their message with their scent. They reach you with all their smells and tell you about the fields they\u2019ve left, the rain that made them grow, the dawns they watched. When I\u2019m outlining the skin of a lovely peach with soft touches of paint or a sad old apple, I catch a glimpse in the reflections they exchange of . . . the same love of the sun, the same recollection of the dew, a freshness.\u201d In still lifes like [i]Kitchen table (Still-life with basket)[/i], C\u00e9zanne had the ambitious goal of creating a monumental painting of everyday objects. He stated: \u201cI shall astonish Paris with an apple\u201d."

        "description": "[i]The Birth of Venus[/i], painted by Sandro Botticelli in the 1480s, is one of the most famous paintings in the world: it is a celebrated work of art and the high point of a visit to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It is also a commercial icon and a line mark of European Art.\n\nThe real subject of the painting and its meaning is a mystery under discussion. Over the centuries, many theories and interpretations have been developed, proving the complexity of this work of art. The composition of the painting is quite simple: in the center, there\u2019s a figure of Venus, goddess of love, standing in a shell being washed up on a beach, blown there by two personifications of winds visible on the left, and welcomed by a maiden on the right. There is a contrast between the title of the work and what it represents: we do not see the moment of Venus\u2019 birth. According to the myth, she was born from the foam of the sea, but the painting shows us the moment when she arrives on land. It is clear that the personifications of the winds are Zephyrus and Aura, one impetuous and the other moderate. But the figure of the girl is uncertain: she could be Spring, a subject dear to Botticelli, because her dress is full of flowers, or the personification of motherhood, or one of the Three Graces. She has branches of roses around her waist, and myrtle branches around her neck - sacred plants for Venus.\n\nThe painting is a masterpiece of linearity and harmonious design, clarity, and brightness of colors, which includes the use of gold in a lot of detail. We have to remember that the painting today is not as glorious it was initially. The colors were brighter, especially the greens of the trees, and the blue of the sky.\n\n[i]The Birth of Venus[/i] is a work of extraordinary innovation, from many points of view. First, it is a representation of a nude woman: this kind of subject was restricted during the Medieval ages - the only exception was an image of Eve in the Garden of Eden. Botticielli produced the image of a beautiful naked woman, with a gaze that is remarkably in direct engagement with the viewer. Next, there is the news of the mythological theme that in the 1480s was absolutely a new type of painting. Botticelli obviously read classical texts before painting it: for example, the Roman writer Plinio made the description of the painting by the Greek artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url] that showed Venus rising from the sea or a Homeric hymn that told about Zephyrus that blows his wind on Aphrodite. \n\nBut not only the classical world was the source of Botticelli's work. He depicted the scene with a solemnity that recalls a religious rite; the disposition of the characters and their gestures remind representations of the Baptism of Christ, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrocchio/the-baptism-of-christ]that of Verrocchio[/url], which Botticelli had certainly seen. This iconographic analogy alludes, perhaps, to a thematic analogy between the mythical birth of the goddess from the sea and the Christian birth of the soul from the water of Baptism.\n\nIt is highly probable that the work was commissioned by a member of the Medici family (perhaps by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, a major patron of Botticelli, under the influence of his cousin Lorenzo de' Medici, \"il Magnifico\"), although there is nothing written about the painting before 1550, when [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari]Giorgio Vasari[/url] describes it in the Medici\u2019s Villa of Castello, owned by the cadet branch of the Medici family since the mid-15th century. This hypothesis would seem to be born out by the orange trees in the painting, which are considered an emblem of the Medici dynasty, on account of the assonance between the family name and the name of the orange tree, which at the time was \u2018[i]mala medica[/i]\u2019."

The assortment of earth and mineral-derived pigments\u2014siennas, ochres, umbers, and blues\u2014that Guston used, and the dry quality of the pigment, were also influenced by the materials and techniques of fresco mural and early Renaissance painting.\r\n\r\nGuston said that what ultimately caused him to leave his figurative narratives of the 1940s was seeing early pictures of Nazi-death camps. It is easy to imagine how those shocking images of stacked bodies could override any potential idea for figuratively realistic composition."

        "description": "In 1884, Gustave Caillebotte painted [i]Man at His Bath[/i], one of the most unconventional and radical male nude paintings of the time. It redefined the genre of the male nude, which was typically reserved for heroic depictions of biblical and mythical figures. While the traditional male nude was employed to represent ideals of heroism, Caillebotte shows the male body in a mundane setting performing a daily function. \n\nFrom the wet footprints on the floor, it appears that the man has just finished bathing and is drying himself off by vigorously rubbing his wet back. Caillebotte depicted the figure from the rear emphasizing the masculine traits of the body: the man stands strong and erect, showing well-defined muscles. He is in an open-legged position, his backside is clenched and tense, as his scrotum peers through his legs. The same year Caillebotte painted another variation of the theme, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/man-drying-his-leg][i]Man Drying His Leg[/i][/url] (1884). In both cases, it appears that Caillebotte used the same model and the same setting, and the paintings share elements such as the chair and the towel.\n\nIn the late 19th century the subject of bathing or nude grooming in art was generally associated with the female nude. [i]Man at His Bath[/i] challenged the gender norms of the time, depicting the nude male in a domestic setting, one that was almost exclusively associated with the female figures. The realism and contemporary setting of the image rejected the principles of the idealized academic male nude. Furthermore, by placing the male nude in a traditionally feminine setting Caillebotte undermined the accepted notions of masculinity.\n\nAt the same time, it can be argued that [i]Man at His Bath[/i] subverted not only traditional imagery but also modern imagery of the female bather. These types of intimate scenes of female grooming were most notable in the work of artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas]Edgar Degas[/url]. Although Degas\u2019s paintings were considered irreverent by his contemporaries, the image of the female bather was still grounded in the long-standing tradition of the female nude in an intimate setting, traditionally incorporated in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/mythological-painting]mythological[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/religious-painting]biblical[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/orientalism]oriental[/url] subjects. Caillebotte owned numerous paintings by Degas, and both [i]Man at His Bath[/i] and [i]Man Drying His Leg[/i] were likely inspired by Degas\u2019s prototype. However, Caillebotte\u2019s versions go beyond it, as they present the male nude in a manner that is completely dislocated from traditional depictions of the subject.\n\nIn 1888, Caillebotte sent [i]Man at His Bath[/i] to the exhibition of the group [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/les-xx]Les XX[/url] (\u2018The Twenty\u2019) in Brussels, Belgium. The painting caused great discomfort among late 19th century viewers, so much so that it was removed from the general view and hidden away into an inaccessible space. After the artist died in 1894, the painting had remained in private collections for over a century until 2011, when it was purchased by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston."

However, Hopper's focus is not the imposing structure of the bridge itself, but the more mundane view of the adjacent neighborhood on the Manhattan side of the river. This scene is most likely the approach to the bridge from Delancey Street, on the Lower East Side; Hopper would have made a preparatory sketch while standing at the location, and then painted the final version in his Greenwich Village studio.\r\nFrom Williamsburg Bridge is a city scene without noise or motion. The light on the buildings is bright and steady, and the only person visible is a woman sitting in profile in a top-floor window. In the visible sections of four ordinary apartment buildings, Hopper establishes a combination of subtle rhythms and repetitions. The windows themselves are rectangles within the rectangles, punched into the facades in orderly rows. Their window shades, raised and lowered at various heights, create subtle variation within the gridlike framework. The profile of the buildings' cornices and a pair of chimneys is sharply defined against a clear sky. This overall play of horizontal and vertical forms is broken only by the angles of two fire escapes and by the unobtrusive railing of the ramp to the bridge, rising at a slight diagonal along the bottom of the canvas. The broad format of this painting implies the continuation of the scene beyond the limits of the canvas: we can imagine the street, the girders of the nearby bridge, and perhaps other, identical brownstone buildings with solitary tenants lost in reverie."

Dressed in swaths of black cloth, which was the most expensive color due to the complex dying process, and decked in pearls and rubies from neck to the hem of the dress, Elisabeth shows herself to be a wealthy Renaissance queen. The open sleeves of her outer gown reveal the striped yellow sleeves underneath, and the expensive white silk lining of the outer garment. She wears a bejewelled coronet, necklace and girdle with precious stones while her hands bear numerous finger and thumb rings. In her right hand, she holds a miniature portrait of Philip II of Spain, her husband, which is a public display of love and affection for her new spouse even though it was probably Phillip who commissioned the portrait of his wife. Elisabeth leans against a large marble column which suggests that she is standing within a grand palace, which again hints at the couple's wealth, power and luxurious lifestyle.\n\nIn Renaissance and early-modern visual culture, the pearl had significant symbolism, especially for women. Therefore it is unsurprising to see the knotted strings of pearls decorating Elisabeth's gown. Pearls were thought to symbolise not only extreme wealth, but also female fertility, as the pearl was thought to be 'born' within the shell of oysters. Thus, in this state portrait the numerous pearls hint at the future children that Elisabeth will bear Phillip. Unfortunately, it would be her fourth pregnancy and second miscarriage which would end Elisabeth's short life."

        "description": "The portrait [i]Giovanna Baccelli[/i] (1782) exemplifies the artist\u2019s mature style, which is characterized by his small and light brushstrokes. The subject of the portrait is Italian dancer Giovanna Baccelli, the principal ballerina at the King\u2019s Theater, Haymarket. The pinnacle of her acclaimed career was during the 1780-1781season when she worked with the famous ballet master Jean-Georges Noverre and ballet dancer Gaetan Vestris. She also achieved great success performing in Venice in 1783-1784, and at the Paris Opera as late as 1788.\n\nBaccelli was equally known for being the last and most enduring mistress of John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset. The two lived a lavish lifestyle, and in 1779, the Duke set up Baccelli in Knole House in Sevenoaks, Kent. She also accompanied him to Paris when he was appointed Ambassador, and the pair were even admitted to the court of Queen Marie-Antoinette. With the outset of the French Revolution, they returned to Knole, where they stayed until they amicably parted ways in 1789. When Gainsborough exhibited Giovanna Baccelli at the Royal Academy in 1782, his other painting, a half-length portrait of the Duke was removed in order to preserve decorum. Baccelli\u2019s talent also inspired Gainsborough\u2019s contemporaries: she was the subject of portraits, lithographs, drawings, and sculptures by artists like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joshua-reynolds]Joshua Reynolds[/url], John Graham, John Boydell, and John Baptiste Locatelli.\nGainsborough painted Baccelli in the costume from her role in [i]Les Amans Supris[/i], a ballet by Louis Simonet that took London by storm in December 1780. He captures Baccelli mid-movement in a dancer pose: her slender foot is extended forward while she elegantly holds the edge of her skirt with her left hand. Through the costume and pose, Gainsborough emphasizes Baccelli\u2019s role as a dancer, capturing the poise and grace she brought to the stage. In preparation for the portrait, Gainsborough created a small oil sketch, that is now in the collection of Sir Alfred Beit at Russborough House. There are several differences between the sketch and the full-length portrait. In the sketch, there is no tambourine, and the trees in the background are much lower. Gainsborough raised the trees in the final version to surround the dancer\u2019s arm, thus drawing more attention to her expression.\n\nIn this mature phase of his career, Gainsborough was interested in different approaches for capturing movement and the effects of light and space. In [i]Giovanna Baccelli[/i], the artist experimented with new ways of depicting a figure in a natural setting. He created a harmonious color scheme, as the blue, pink, and white tones of Baccelli\u2019s dress echo in the colors of the sky and landscape. The painting is one of the finest examples of Gainsborough\u2019s mature portrait style: not only he captures the likeness of his subject but also demonstrates his masterly brushwork of small, quick, and light strokes. Through the delicate brushwork, the artist creates the illusion of movement, that injects liveliness into the portrait. The portrait was praised by critics, and one commented that it was \u2018original, light airy and elegant\u2019 like Baccelli herself."

To the rear are the top representatives of this nocturnal life, including Jane Avril in the feathered hat.\n\nThe Moorish Dance (right panel) recalls the belly dance show performed by La Goulue inside her booth, loosely inspired by eastern choreographies. The audience is placed in bold perspective in the foreground, and was composed of friends of Toulouse-Lautrec such as Oscar Wilde, seen from behind, and the well-known critic and backer Felix Feneon, in the bottom right-hand corner. The artist has also featured himself amid this colorful audience."

        "description": "At the age of nineteen, Leonora Carrington discovered [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url] through Herbert Read\u2019s book on the movement ([i]Surrealism[/i], London 1936). She was drawn into the movement\u2019s orbit through her relationship with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-ernst]Max Ernst[/url], developing her own richly individual imagery that grew out of her childhood obsessions. In the period 1937-41, added impetus came from the tensions engendered by Ernst\u2019s rejected wife, Marie-Berthe Aurenche, and then by his imprisonment on the declaration of war. Escaping occupied France, Carrington crossed into Spain in a state of mental collapse and eventually reached Portugal in 1941, only to encounter Ernst travelling with the American collector Peggy Guggenheim to New York.\n\n[i]Do you know my Aunt Eliza?[/i] includes one of Carrington\u2019s central images: the horse. The robed and horse-headed figure with a crucifix towers over a sinister accomplice. The imagery is ambiguous, as Carrington often used the horse as a sign of dynamism and speed and sovereignty. This aspect is seen most notably in her major early painting [i]The Inn of the Dawn Horse[/i] 1936-7 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, reproduced in Aberth 2004, p.31), but also in the frozen horse in Portrait of Max Ernst 1939 (reproduced in Aberth 2004, p.43), whose pose, incidentally, anticipates that in Do you know my Aunt Eliza? One recent commentator has added that the horse was \u2018multi-determined\u2019, representing for Carrington \u2018her access to the invisible world, the sustenance of her internal reality, and the energy that provides her with the impetus to transcend the irrationality of the human world\u2019 (Salomon Grimberg, \u2018Leonora Carrington and Julien Levy\u2019, in Tribute to Julien Levy, auction catalogue, Tajan, Paris, October 2004, opposite lots 482-5). In Do you know my Aunt Eliza?, however, the atmosphere is darkly threatening, the horse\u2019s eyeless gaze is matched by the blind stare of its human accomplice. In the context of the artist\u2019s lapsed Catholicism, this image recalls the biting parody of religion found in Francisco Goya (1746-1828), whose bleak etchings may also be remembered in the dense hatching of this drawing. Related drawings, including an untitled image which evokes a witches coven (Tribute to Julien Levy 2004, lot 458), reinforce this association.\n\nIt has been inferred, from the quality of the materials and the finish, that the ink drawings (of which I am an Amateur of Velocipedes is another), were made once Carrington had reached New York in 1941 (Grimberg 2004). They evidently relate closely to more hurried pencil sketches made as part of Carrington\u2019s therapy under Dr Morales in Santander in 1940. The horse image appears in many of these with a similar ambiguity, oscillating between nightmare and self-identification. The artist relived her breakdown in the searing novel Down Below (1943, republished in Carrington 1989, pp.163-209), but a note to her father (that at one time accompanied the sketches) gives, with raw immediacy, a sense of the collapse: \u2018It is difficult for you to imagine what very hard work it is to reconstruct a complete nervous wreck ... I think you had better know that I have been very close to lunacy\u2019 (Tribute to Julien Levy 2004, lot 694).\n\nThe question that serves as this drawing\u2019s title is inscribed on the back. Just as with I am an Amateur of Velocipedes, it can be related to Carrington\u2019s story Little Francis (republished in Carrington 1989, pp.163-209). This tells of the destructive rivalry for Uncle Ubriaco\u2019s affection between Amelia, his daughter, and her cousin Francis. These characters thinly disguise Marie-Berthe, Ernst and Carrington herself, the conflict that, in part at least, precipitated her breakdown. The central passages, which focuses on Francis (the Carrington figure), concern his attempts to retain Ubriaco. On being forced to move-on by the immanent arrival of Amelia, he sings \u2018rather dejectedly\u2019, while cycling (Carrington 1989, p.110):"

The ghostly trace of a boat to the right of centre, which has been painted over, suggests that Turner decided to emphasise the vastness of the sky and sea rather than human industry.\n\nThe title, The Evening Star, was not Turner\u2019s, but was given to the painting decades later because of the presence of a star \u2013 a tiny dab of thick white paint. Although originally thought to be unfinished, Turner may actually have been satisfied with the painting\u2019s evocation of a particular moment and not seen the need for additional work on it."

Major Rathbone lept to his feet and grabbed Booth and Booth dropped his pistol. They struggled and fought, when Booth pulled out a knife and stabbed Rathbone near his shoulder before pushing him against the wall. Booth then turned to jump from the balcony and Rathbone sat up and grabbed onto Booth's coat causing him to dangle over the balcony, Booth fell down to the stage, catching the spur of his boot on a draped American flag and breaking his leg. He yelled \"Sic semper tyrannis!\" (Thus always to tyrants.) and escaped leaving the dying President behind. Some witnesses state that he also yelled \"The South's is avenged!\" Union soldiers cornered him twelve days later in a barn in Caroline County, Virginia, where he died of a bullet wound."

        "description": "[i]Lunatics[/i] (2001-2002) by Odd Nerdrum is an enigmatic scene with an apocalyptic atmosphere: it could be an ancient civilization or a society from the distant future. [i]Lunatics[/i] should be understood in the context of Nerdrum\u2019s body of work, as it built upon ideas the artist explored in earlier paintings. In the early phases of his career, Nerdrum focused on contemporary subjects and everyday reality. However, by the early 1980s his subject matter drastically changed. The artist began constructing a new world which described a primordial and archetypal existence. In the beginning his paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/the-ultimate-sight-1985][i]The Ultimate Sight[/i][/url] (1985) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/return-of-the-sun][i]Return of the Sun[/i][/url] (1986-1995) depicted some type of ritualistic activity, and later paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/pregnant-women-with-followers-1999][i]Pregnant Women with Followers[/i][/url] (1999) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/sleeping-prophet-2000][i]Sleeping Prophet[/i][/url] (2000) showed a group led by a prophet figure.\n\n[i]Lunatics[/i] is situated in a similar kind of reality. Ten figures are scattered in a barren landscape wearing strange garbs: cloaks, armor, fancy headdresses and helmets. However, unlike the aforementioned paintings, there is no clear leader or purposeful activity taking place. The group in [i]Lunatics[/i] is in a state of repose: they are all waiting, but each figure is on its own, isolated from the other individuals in the vast space. This state of alienation is also seen in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/dawn-1990][i]Dawn[/i][/url] (1990), where four identical figures are turned sideways with their mouths gaping. The sense of isolation in [i]Dawn[/i] is expressed through the mute screams, but no such aggressiveness is apparent in [i]Lunatics[/i]. In contrast to the tight composition of [i]Dawn[/i], [i]Lunatics[/i] has a tremendous sense of space and depth, of the never-ending landscape. It also has a rich color palette of deep violets, and scarlets, and tones of blue, that harmoniously play against shades of ochre and gold. The scenery in [i]Lunatics[/i] is consistent with the desolate environment shown in [i]Dawn[/i] and other paintings. This type of landscape, also seen in [i]Dawn[/i], was likely based on the Nerdrum\u2019s extensive studies of the Icelandic landscape. This barren environment, scarce in resources, is often a backdrop for scenes of violence like in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/iron-law-1984][i]Iron Law[/i][/url] (1983-1984) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/woman-kills-injured-man][i]Woman Killing Injured Man[/i][/url] (1994). In [i]Lunatics[/i] Nerdrum evolves to another phase. Although there is a sense of alienation in [i]Lunatics[/i], there is also a feeling of togetherness, or at least a desire for community and family. According to scholar Matthew Ballou, the group in [i]Lunatics[/i] is in a meditative state. Their silence can be interpreted as spiritual or ritual, like a congregation in the Eucharist.\n\nNerdrum\u2019s paintings aim to tell the essential nature of human experiences. The first stages of community and the human desire for unity depicted in [i]Lunatics[/i] is more explicit in Nerdrum\u2019s works like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/flock][i]Flock[/i][/url] (2006) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/odd-nerdrum/wanderers-by-the-sea][i]Wanderers by the Sea[/i][/url] (2000). [i]Lunatics[/i] captures the experience of isolation, but at the same time hints at the basic human desire to create community and eventually society."

Until the 18th century, many artists had not made much use of chalks, but in this portrait Boucher uses them to their utmost capacity, creating billowing green shrubbery and soft fleshy bodies. "

The similarity between these two works and the contextual evidence (the art, literature, and pageantry of the period) support the view that Bruegel's subject was the improper use of wealth \u2014 a central issue for humanist Christians in the Low Countries in the 1560's."

This contrasts sharply with Cubist compositions in which objects and backgrounds seem to be constantly shifting, with individual components of the overall work of equal importance for the most part. Additionally, the bright blue dress rejects the customary, drab palette of early Cubism. Lempicka's paintings often feature limited palettes but the color is rarely subdued and the colors she selects are often in step with the tastes of the period."

The Neoclassical style, along with the strong verticals of the trees and houses paired with the horizontal arrangement of the figures, creates a sense of harmony and stability. Penn, dressed in brown, stands in the center of the composition with his arms outstretched, surrounded by his fellow Quakers and Merchants. The Native Americans dominate the darker, right side of the painting, and their gestures and postures draw the viewer's eye to the central action. Two merchants kneel and offer the tribal leader a bolt of cream-colored cloth, which was a customary diplomatic gesture at the time. The painting becomes a metaphor for fairness and mutual exchange between Old World and New.\n\nHowever, West masks and elides the appalling and horrific ways in which colonists and the U.S. government treated Native Americans. The houses in the background, along with the ships in the port, speak to the dramatic and devastating changes that would come to the Native American way of life. As an allegorical representation, West may have been thinking of the increasing tensions between the colonies and the British Crown, hoping for a calm and balanced relationship as depicted in the painting. Colonial theorist Beth Fowkes Tobin argues that the painting is a masterpiece, not only aesthetically but also politically as a powerful piece of propaganda that continues to work its magic on viewers today."

A consummate draftsman, she relied on the graphic arts-in the form of prints, illustrations, and posters-as a powerful instrument of political allegiance to her left-leaning social agenda. She was anti-war, anti-violence, and a believer in the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nKollwitz's dramatic night scene, part of her Peasant War print cycle, depicts a mother searching for her dead son among a field of corpses. In the soft light of the lantern, her weathered hand is illuminated as she touches the chin of a young man, perhaps her own child. Rather than portray the chaos and brutality of battle, Kollwitz shows us the agonizing aftermath of the fighting when the bodies of the dead were claimed by their loved ones. Though the scene alludes to the atrocities of a 16th-century workers revolt, it stands as a universal statement of a mother's love for her son, made more heartbreaking in that it foreshadows the death of Kollwitz's own son, Peter, who was killed in battle shortly after the start of the First World War (1914-1918)."

        "description": "As the title suggests, Francis Bacon\u2019s [i]Study After Velazquez\u2019s Portrait of Innocent X [/i](1953) was inspired by the 17th century portrait [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/portrait-of-pope-innocent-x-1650][i]Pope Innocent X[/i][/url] (1650) by Spanish painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez]Diego Velazquez[/url]. In fact, Bacon was fascinated with the figure of the Pope throughout the 1950s and and the early 1960s, painting around fifty portraits of the subject matter. One of the starting points for this series was Velazquez\u2019s portrait: Bacon was transfixed with the painting keeping several reproductions in his studio. However, while visiting Rome in 1954, he chose not see the original painting at the [i]Galleria Doria Pamphilj[/i]. Velazquez, who painted the Pope at the height of his political power, created a portrait that embodied his authority and status as a spiritual leader. Bacon\u2019s [i]Study After Velazquez\u2019s Portrait of Innocent X[/i] shatters this image with the depiction of the screaming Pope. \n\nHis papal portrait presents a critical perspective of traditional papal portraits, as well as a broader critique of Christianity. For Bacon, the Pope is a kind of tragic figure, that renounces all individuality and self-identity to uphold a public role of a stifling belief system. This system of oppression is the source of violence Bacon portrays in [i]Study After Velazquez\u2019s Portrait of Innocent X[/i]. By painting vertical folds of color, he creates a unique pictorial space that gives the illusion of an isolated space or cage - a pictorial device known as \u2018space frames\u2019. Bacon\u2019s use of \u2018space frames\u2019 relates to the work of his contemporary, Italian sculptor [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alberto-giacometti]Alberto Giacometti[/url]. The \u2018space-frame\u2019 was a motif in Giacometti\u2019s sculpture [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alberto-giacometti/cage][i]Cage[/i][/url] (1930-31) and a framing device in his later paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alberto-giacometti/diego-seated-1948][i]Diego Seated[/i][/url] (1948). The technique of distancing the figure was applied by Old Masters, for instance [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url] in his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/filippo-archinto][i]Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto[/i][/url] (ca. 1558). \n\nIn Bacon\u2019s case the \u2018space frame\u2019 can be a visual representation of psychological entrapment, which is also conveyed through the Pope\u2019s chilling cry of horror. The screaming Pope can be linked to post existential [i]angst[/i] and Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s concept of the \u2018death of God\u2019. Bacon, a staunch atheist, exposes the Pope as an empty symbol by visually deconstructing the powerful figure portrayed by Velazquez. \n\nThe disintegrated figure in [i]Study After Velazquez\u2019s Portrait of Innocent X[/i] is traced to Bacon\u2019s earlier painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/head-iv-1949][i]Head VI[/i][/url] (1949). This was the first time Bacon referenced Velazquez\u2019s Pope Innocent X. The study of the head develops into a full portrait in [i]Study After Velazquez\u2019s Portrait of Innocent X[/i]. In both paintings color played an important role in transforming Velazquez\u2019s dignified portrait painted in soft and muted tones. Bacon used a garish purple to replace the lush red of the Pope\u2019s cape, and he heightened the color contrast with the translucent yellow and gold throne. The purple cape in particular is recurring in Bacon\u2019s papal portraits, for example [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/pope-i-1951][i]Pope I[/i][/url] (1951) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/untitled-pope-1954][i]Untitled (Pope)[/i][/url] (c.1954). The glaring colors against the dark background heighten the sense of drama, and enhance the disturbing atmosphere evoked by Bacon\u2019s portrait."

He is considered the founder of Russian constructivism. Tatlin\u2019s name is associated with the most daring experiments in the art of the 20th century. He combined plastics and spatial forms, artistic and utilitarian properties of materials, which made it possible to completely reform the illusory nature of the pictorial plane and bring it to three-dimensional scale. In his early paintings Tatlin was influenced by Pablo Picasso, further advancing and mastering his cubistic theories. He operated with large, rhythmically coordinated surfaces combining the features of cubism, modernism and futurism, expressively embodied the universal rhythm. In his book \"Tatlin (Against Cubism)\u201d published in 1921, Nikolai Punin presented a coherent theory of the evolution of contemporary art. Punin concluded that the evolution of art progressed from predominance of light in impressionism, followed by predominance of color and modeling of spatial surfaces in Cezanne\u2019s paintings, to the illusion of three-dimensional space and textures that replaced the predominance of color in cubists. The final stage of evolution of art was the use of real space by Tatlin. \"Tatlin's creativity in terms of its formal achievements, genetically rising to the impressionism, shows everything that only mankind has gained in the field of plastic art, striving to realize its basic law-the law of loading.\nHowever, renaissance and recognition of Tatlin\u2019s artistic ideas in 1920\u2019s, his art was mocked, prosecuted and forbidden during the next decades. At the exhibition \"Artists of the RSFSR for 15 years\" in 1933, Tatlin\u2019s works were displayed in the hall of \"formalistic trends.\" It was his last public exhibition. Unfortunately, not many works of the artist\u2019s late period still exist. In the few remaining paintings we see two main tendencies: one is lyrical, ala prima, translucent, watercolor like oil paintings and the other is dramatic, intense, with bold usage of contrasting tones, reminiscent of stained-glass technique.\nIn this painting, we see an urban landscape, seemingly simple and peaceful composition depicting a narrow street of Leningrad. At the same time, it is full of inner tension and sense of desolation. This contradictory image is achieved by using contrasting tones and lines. Palette of the painting is very limited. The black color plays the main role, while gradations of gray, cold white and light yellow do not brighten the composition as one might expect, but instead strengthen the sense of loneliness and isolation of two human figures. The painting is dated 1936 and it could be seen as a very symbolic portrayal of its time. It had been two years since the official birth of the Soviet Social realism which was declared as a mandatory style in all fields of the Soviet culture. In opposition to the Communist guidelines, Tatlin created this painting that reflected his skeptical attitude towards the prescribed \u201cofficial art.\u201d"

Palmer's pictures of this period are intensely personal, and often have a mystical, even visionary quality comparable to the work of William Blake (1757-1827). Palmer was greatly inspired by Blake's illustrations to Ambrose Philips's imitation of Virgil's First Eclogue (1821) and could have been describing his own work when he wrote of the Blake engravings: 'They are visions of little dells, and nooks, and corners of Paradise; models of the exquisitist pitch of intense poetry...There is in all such a mystic and dreamy glimmer as penetrates and kindles the inmost soul' (A.H.

Until the present day, it has been speculated that the portrait of Simonetta is actually just an idealized version of the actual living muse of Florence, transpired into perfection through Botticelli\u2019s mind eye. \n\nThe lore says that the maestro was in love with the young beauty, but never quite being able to fulfill this loving desire as she was a married woman. It is said that he painted her image to resemble how perfect she was to him, rather than to show her real beauty. He did not miss a chance to worship her by giving her the roles of high goddesses in his mythological themed paintings. Allegedly, Simonetta\u2019s visage served as main inspiration for Pallas Athena ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/pallas-and-centaur][i]Pallas and Centaur[/i][/url], c.1482), Flora ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/primavera-1478][i]Primavera[/i][/url], 1478), and even for the infamous Venus in numerous instances ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/the-birth-of-venus-1485][i]The birth of Venus[/i][/url], 1485; [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/venus-and-mars-1483-1][i]Venus and Mars[/i][/url], 1483); she also possibly was a prototype for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piero-di-cosimo]Piero di Cosimo[/url]\u2019s  [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piero-di-cosimo/portrait-of-simonetta-vespucci-as-cleopatra-1490][i]Portrait of a Woman[/i][/url] (1490).\n\nBotticelli\u2019s portrait of \u201cla bella Simonetta\u201d reveals a specific technique developed in the early Renaissance years. In order to obtain the flawless complexion of the character, the artist uses a special mixture, terre verte - a green, earthy tone - to under paint, and afterward layers the flesh- like tones over it to create diverse shades of pink, yellow, and orange. Botticelli shows brilliant control of the tempera painting technique making use of fine lines and shapes to discreetly build up contrasts and create the depth and texture of the portrait."

The picturesque type of Italian country girl known as a ciociara was an extremely popular subject among European painters travelling in Italy at this period. Located in a setting skilfully constructed through the use of a low-level light, Rosales sketches out the figure using broad brushstrokes and rich colours.\n\nThe model\u00b4s ample blouse, bluish skirt and dark bodice contrast with the painting\u00b4s overall greenish-brown color scheme. Also notable are the relaxed brushstrokes, applied with broad, broken gestures. The lighting and the demarcation of the figure\u00b4s silhouette help to build the figure in space. In that sense, this work is close to the sobriety of Corot or Courbet\u00b4s French realism, while the imprecise drawing of the young woman\u00b4s hands and the resultant sense of movement recall some of Velasquez\u00b4s works. This painting was acquired for the Museum of Modern Art on 18 November 1940.\n\n(Taken from the site)"

The right side of the table is not in the same plane as the left side of the table, which was a stylized method used by Cezanne to incorporate the differences of viewpoint into an impressionistic still life. It was this technique that made it possible to bridge the gap between impressionists and cubism, which employed varying perspective and varying angles to depict subjects. As such, this still life is an example of the way in which Cezanne tried to deal with the complexities of visual perception. "

Visiting the basement reserves of a certain museum with a curator who happened to be a friend, Max had admired a splendid Esquimo housepole leaning in a corner.  It was a gigantic fertility figure carved from a tree and doted with an appropriate crack where one is needed to prove her maternal possibilities. \"How come such a stunning piece is not on show up in the galleries?\" Max asked his friend.  \"Oh, but we can't display that here \u2013 there are whole classes of schoolgirls that visit the museum almost daily...it is too bad...\"  This was something especially hard for Max to understand in view of the fact that the girls \u2013 it is to be hoped at any rate \u2013 all had cracks of their own.  Happily for us, after some negotiating we acquired the housepole in all her maternal glory.  (From then on, she moved with us across continents and seas like the veriest sophisticated traveler.)  Five years later we visit the same museum together.  An important number of paintings from the Louvre had been kept safe from the war, and we again meet the curator and visit the reserves below.  Here, unbelievably, is the great Bain Turque of Ingres, hidden away from little girls or, perhaps, old ones, in any case, not seen in the antiseptic U.S.A.  This visit took place in 1948 and we were driving back to Sedona.  Before leaving the museum and its masterpieces I bought the comprehensive catalogue of works in the collection.  It seemed to me something like inviting a good friend to come along to share our life.\r\n\r\nThat life turned out to be so absorbing that the big book stayed on its shelf until one day I needed it badly.  To explain: The painting I was at work on (it became The Guest Room), involved a nude, and I had to have a model.  Down the road from us lived Patsy, ten years old.  Patsy would do, and her mother couldn't care less.  But Patsy wouldn't strip.  Indeed, I was prepared for the panties but not a bra (hiding nothing).  Suddenly I was telling Patsy about Art, about the great museum, in the same town where the President of the United States lives and where it is well understood (by some museum visitors) that the most beautiful object of nature is the human body.  \"I'll show you,\" I cried, rushing to open the book, rifling the pages, faster and faster, that's strange, I had seen them there, the Gauguin bathers, the Poussins, the Italian allegories... Alas, these had not made it into the book, which was thus safe for schoolgirls.\r\n\r\nAll this was back in the dark (artwise) ages of half a century ago.  It surely couldn't happen today, surely not, except maybe in Texas!\r\n - Dorothea Tanning"

He says he painted about he painted about \u00bd square inch a day, and never changed anything as he went.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what he says about his titles:\r\n\r\nI will tell you why. When I was a boy I met all of these artists and they would have titles like Boys Sitting by a Stream, The Sunshine on the Girl\u2019s Hat, Girl Holding a Daisy, Boy Eating an Apple. I got pretty tired of them. I heard them from 1903 until 1920. I probably was the first one who decided not to have those titles; I was going to have something that the painting said.\r\n\r\nIf you know art and like art, you will see so much in it. I thought, to help people along, I would take a title with a little other, you might say, dimension. If, for instance, I bring a picture of Ida into the world, it becomes Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida. She was a 20-year-old married woman, and I knew they were going to call her a prostitute and ugly, so I called her a soul. Not everybody can call a soul a prostitute.\r\n\r\nI like to get a little bit of my philosophy in the title, and I like That Which I Should Have Done. It happens to almost everybody, almost every day.\"\r\n\r\nSource- http://my.firedoglake.com/masaccio/2011/01/22/saturday-art-that-which-i-should-have-done-i-did-not-do-the-door-by-ivan-albright/"

[i]Daughter and Mother [/i]is perhaps more chaste in subject matter, but continues in the artist's tradition of working with voluptuous curves and seductive women. Conflating iconic compositions from art history with the artificially rendered stock imagery of contemporary illustration, Currin creates images which are both banal and uncanny, that simultaneously seduce and repel.\n\nIn Daughter and Mother, Currin presents a classically centered, closely-cropped composition of two women of seemingly similar age, the only clue that they are related comes from the artist's title. Currin deliberately omits any further narrative elements, obfuscating the viewer's comprehension of the figures' apparent sentimentality. Rendering his figures in an almost academic realism that recalls the uncanny imagery of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rene-magritte]Magritte[/url], Currin's work operates in a similar fashion to the modern master by undermining the viewer's expectation of a readily discernible narrative."

        "description": "At age 38, Roy Lichtenstein created the breakthrough painting [i]Look Mickey[/i] (1961) that declared the emergence of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pop-art]Pop Art[/url] style. Lichtenstein appropriated the scene from popular culture, showing two Disney icons, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in a humorous situation. In the painting, Mickey and Donald are on a pier: Donald swings the fishing pole above his head thinking he caught a fish when in fact he snagged his coattail. Mickey tries to stifle his laughter while Donald naively says in the bubble text: \u201cLook Mickey, I\u2019ve hooked a big one\u201d.\nMultiple stories were told about the origins of the legendary painting: Lichtenstein discovered the image in a bubble gum wrapper, the idea came about during a drawing game with his children or he was inspired by a conversation with the artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/allan-kaprow]Allan Kaprow[/url]. Most likely, the source was an illustration in the 1960s children's book [i]Donald Duck: Lost and Found[/i]. Lichtenstein\u2019s interest in the subject, that culminated in the painting [i]Look Mickey[/i] (1961), began four years earlier. In 1957 he used a projector to trace a large image of Mickey Mouse on his son\u2019s bedroom wall. The characters of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Bugs Bunny were featured in earlier works: a series of paintings that were later destroyed, and drawings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/mickey-mouse-i-1958][i]Mickey Mouse I[/i][/url] (1958) that mixed coarse strokes of pastel, crayon, and ink.\n\nIn [i]Look Mickey[/i], Lichtenstein explored the idea of mechanical reproduction in the printing process, imitating the technique through the language of painting. He hand-painted dots on Mickey\u2019s face and in Donald\u2019s eyes mimicking the ink dots of the Ben-Day printing process that was used in the production of inexpensive comic books and magazines. The artist made subtle changes to the original image in order to present a more cohesive image. He omitted background figures, rotated the point of view by 90 degrees, and limited his palette to the three primary colors and white. By appropriating an image from popular culture, and placing it in the context of fine art, Lichtenstein injected irony and humor into the painting. Lichtenstein\u2019s image is ambiguous, the viewer can identify both with the narrator, Mickey, and the victim, Donald.\n\nThe painting represented a radical stylistic shift in Lichtenstein\u2019s art, who hoped that by presenting something completely different he would break through to the forefront of mainstream art. Lichtenstein admitted that the painting reflected his feelings on his professional status: \u201cThe subject of the painting is me\u201d. In this way, the two characters can represent Lichtenstein\u2019s sentiment toward this artistic experiment. Donald\u2019s enthusiastic attempt represents his ambition and hope for an artistic breakthrough, while Mickey represents the sobering reality and possibility that it might fail miserably.\n\n[i]Look Mickey[/i] brought Lichtenstein the mainstream success he hoped for, but it also received harsh criticism. He was criticized for counterfeiting commercial images, and famously an art critic called him one of the worst artists in America. Art historians and critics regard [i]Look Mickey[/i] as revolutionary work that announced the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop Art[/url] movement. The artist highlighted the significance of the painting in a later work, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/artists-studio-look-mickey-1973][i]Artist's Studio\u2014Look Mickey [/i][/url] (1973), in which the painting is featured prominently on the back wall."

As early as 1827 he conceived a cycle of paintings that would illustrate the rise and fall of a civilization, and a few years later he began sketching and developing his ideas. \n\n[i]The Consummation of Empire[/i] is one of a sequence of five paintings entitled [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-cole/all-works#!#filterName:Series_the-course-of-empire,resultType:masonry][i]The Course of Empire[/i][/url] commissioned by Cole's patron Luman Reed, created between 1833 and 1836. Each painting in the series depicts the same landscape at a different stage of the rise and fall of an imaginary civilization. This middle painting in the series represents the apparent triumph of that civilization, a scene crammed with classical porticos, rotundas, and statuary, with a happy, colorful procession of citizens passing over the bridge in the center. A statue of Minerva, goddess of wisdom, stands to the right but seems to be ignored by the hordes beneath.\n\nThe whole series was intended to serve as a warning about the over-weaning ambitions of Empire. Even this depiction of Empire at the height of its power anticipates its demise in the representation of a militaristic ruler carried aloft by the citizens. Later paintings in the sequence show the ruin of the city, and its eventual reclamation by nature, which in this image seems entirely subdued (as represented by the potted plant in the foreground). Anxious to create an epic series of paintings, and inspired by the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/neoclassicism]Neoclassical[/url] masterpieces he had seen firsthand during his travels in Europe in 1829-1832, Cole nonetheless showed his unique ability through [i]The Course of Empire[/i] to capture the American spirit in his work. These paintings sound a note of both triumph - America had recently liberated itself from the British Empire - and caution: that the new state should not fall into the same traps as its European predecessors. More than that, the series seems to express Cole's anxiety about the encroaching threat of industry and urban expansion to the American landscape.\n\nThomas Cole\u2019s importance and influence as an American artist exploded during the mid-1830s and his career flourished in the early 1840s. He deeply influenced his immediate peers and successive generations of American artists. He transformed the landscape genre from a reflective art to a medium of expressing historical, social, and political theory. By producing titanic icons of classical liberal, romantic, [i]locofoco[/i] historical and social theory, Thomas Cole stands as one of the most influential fine artists in the history of liberal thought."

His early submissions to the Salon reveal this fierce desire to succeed. After his ambitious Equality before Death (1849), the young man aimed to create an impression once again. He put forward an even larger painting inspired by Dante whose work was much loved by the Romantics and who captured all its dramatic beauty. This painting was inspired by a short scene from the Inferno, set in the eighth circle of Hell (the circle for falsifiers and counterfeiters), where Dante, accompanied by Virgil, watches a fight between two damned souls: Capocchio, a heretic and alchemist is attacked and bitten on the neck by Gianni Schicchi who had usurped the identity of a dead man in order to fraudulently claim his inheritance.\n\nThe critic and poet Th\u00e9ophile Gautier was very complimentary: \"Gianni Schicchi throws himself at Capocchio, his rival, with a strange fury, and Monsieur Bouguereau depicts magnificently through muscles, nerves, tendons and teeth, the struggle between the two combatants. There is bitterness and strength in this canvas \u2013 strength, a rare quality!\u201d In fact, Bouguereau here shows great boldness. He is exploring the aesthetic boundaries: exaggerating the muscle structure to the point of distorting it, exaggerating the poses, contrasting colour and shadows, depicting monstrous figures and groups of damned souls. We are particularly reminded of the sublime visions of Romantic artists like Blake (1757-1827), F\u00fcssli (1741-1825), and Lawrence (1769-1830). Everything in this painting underlines the feeling of terribilita and horror: a theme to which Bouguereau would never again return."

The humanoid figure runs through the canvas, evincing a mood of panic and fear. A bloodied sword of violence stands upright in the background.

It was described by in The Guardian in 2011 as \"Satan holding court in what looks like a solo performance in the Albert Hall (decades in advance)\".\r\n\r\nPopular success of John Martin's religious paintings, particularly Belshazzar's Feast (first exhibited at the British Institution in 1821, and published as engravings in 1826), led to a commission in 1823 from London publisher Septimus Prowett for Martin to illustrate a new edition of Milton's Paradise Lost. Martin made mezzotint engravings of 24 subjects in two sizes, 48 plates in all, with large prints measuring 8 by 11 inches and small prints 6 by 8 inches.\r\n\r\nThe engraving of Satan Presiding at the Infernal Council illustrates the debate among Satan's \"Stygian Council\" in the council-chamber of Pand\u00e6monium at the beginning of Book II of Paradise Lost. In the engraving, Satan is depicted enthroned at the heart of the hall of his Palace of Pand\u00e6monium, at the centre of a rotunda filled with onlooking throngs of fallen angels, illuminated by the new technology of gaslight. His throne is placed atop a black hemisphere. The composition may be inspired by an illustration in the 1782 edition of William Beckford's novel Vathek.\r\n\r\nThe prints were published by subscription from 1825 to 1827, with two prints and accompanying text published each month, to be bound together by the subscriber. The engravings were also available to buy separately as sets or single prints. The book and the engravings were considerable critical and commercial success, with Martin's original compositions praised for their invention and power. Martin was encouraged to start work on engraved illustrations of the Bible, and published a further large format print of Satan Presiding at the Infernal Council in 1831, measuring 60.7 cm by 81.4 cm.\r\n\r\nAccording to musicologist Edward Lockspeiser, this engraving had a singular effect and a lasting influence on the composer Hector Berlioz.\r\n\r\nThe bold iconography and design of Martin's engravings were inspirations for scenes in D. W. Griffith's films Birth of a Nation and Intolerance, and for the design of the Galactic Senate in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace."

The original work included pictures of women drinking alcohol, cells depicting sexually transmitted diseases, Leon Trotsky and a portrait of Lenin, which upset Rockefeller, who commissioned the work. He demanded that the face of Lenin be changed, but Rivera refused. Rockefeller immediately paid for the work, dismissed Rivera, and covered the mural.

        "description": "[i]Le Pont de l\u2019Europe[/i] (The Europe Bridge) (1876) depicts the contemporary Parisian life of the last quarter of the XIX century. The location would be easily recognized by Caillebotte\u2019s contemporaries \u2013 the large bridge, located above the railroad station [i]Gare Saint Lazare[/i] connected six avenues, each of which was named after a different European capital. Caillebotte painted the scene from the view of [i]Rue de Vienne[/i], looking toward the plaza.\n\nThe central figures in the composition are a couple strolling along the bridge and a working-class man peering from the bridge looking toward the train station. The man with the female companion is a [i]fl\u00e2neur[/i] \u2013 a term that describes an upper class \u2018stroller\u2019 or \u2018lounger\u2019 that wanders leisurely observing society around him. Scholars have suggested that the [i]fl\u00e2neur[/i] resembles Caillebotte himself, while the female is identified as his friend and model, Anne Marie-Hagen. Caillebotte, who often used his friends as models, painted Hagen on several occasions including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/la-femme-a-la-rose-1884][i]La femme \u00e0 la rose[/i][/url] (1884) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/portrait-of-a-young-woman-in-an-interior][i]Portrait de jeune femme dans un int\u00e9rieur (Portrait de Mme H)[/i][/url] (c. 1877). Photography was an important influence on Caillebotte\u2019s art. In the case of [i]Le Pont de l\u2019Europe[/i], Caillebotte may have modeled the fl\u00e2neur after a photograph of himself with his dog. In both the painting and the photograph, the man wears a top hat and a double-breasted coat. Several [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/study-for-le-pont-de-leurope-1876-0]preparatory sketches[/url] for [i]Le Pont de l\u2019Europe[/i] show that Caillebotte slightly changed the man\u2019s pose. In the photograph, Caillebotte slightly raises his right foot and is more constrained in his movement. In comparison, the man in the painting is confidently striding forward.\n\nThe painting is dominated by the structure of the bridge that indicates the modernization of the urban transformation of the city. The bridge, built between 1865 and 1868 was a small component of a sweeping renovation of Paris commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III and directed by his prefect of Seine, Baron Georges Haussmann. The new Parisian landscape of boulevards, crowds, and leisure activities became a popular subject for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionist[/url] painters. Caillebotte became acquainted with members of the Impressionist movement around 1874, and in 1876 he was invited to participate in the second Impressionist exhibition. In the coming period, he painted several large canvases in which he meticulously emphasized the architectural elements of the urban landscape. At the third Impressionist exhibition in 1877, he exhibited three paintings depicting modern life in the new urban landscape: [i]Le Pont de l\u2019Europe[/i], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/paris-a-rainy-day][i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i][/url] (1877) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/the-house-painters-1877][i]The House Painters[/i][/url] (1877).\n\nThe source for the composition of [i]Le Pont de l\u2019Europe[/i] is the Japanese color woodcut [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hiroshige/7-shops-with-cotton-goods-in-odenma-cho-1857][i]Cotton goods lane, Odenma-cho[/i][/url] (c.1857) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hiroshige]Utagawa Hiroshige[/url] from his series [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hiroshige/all-works#!#filterName:Series_one-hundred-famous-views-of-edo,resultType:masonry][i]One hundred famous views of Edo[/i][/url]. The two street scenes are different in terms of the subject: Caillebotte\u2019s painting shows the latest achievements in engineering and urban planning, while Hiroshige\u2019s woodcut depicts two geishas walking next to a row of shops in a pre-industrial city. Still, Caillebotte retained the main elements of Hiroshige\u2019s composition: the lines and angles of the bridge are very close to those of the row of shops. In [i]Le Pont de l\u2019Europe[/i], Caillebotte widened the angles, shifting the composition to a horizontal format and adding a background."

        "description": "In June 1930, Orozco completed his first major mural in the United States, [i]Prometheus[/i] (1930) at Pomona College in California. Orozco was commissioned to paint the mural in Frary Hall at the encouragement of Jos\u00e9 Pijo\u00e1n, professor of Hispanic civilization and art history. Orozco stayed at the campus dormitory in Pomona College and painted the mural over two months.\n\nThe subject of the mural is the Greek myth about the Titan Prometheus, who stole the fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to humanity. The central mural depicts Prometheus reaching for fire, preparing to bring it to earth. The ceiling panel depicts stylized flames emerging from a composition of geometric forms \u2013 these are generally understood as a symbolic representation of God, the source of the fire of knowledge. Many have suggested that Orozco identified with the myth of Prometheus and have drawn parallels between the mural and his personal history. This was a frustrating time in Orozco\u2019s career, he felt artistically isolated and underappreciated, often received by indifferent or hostile audiences. The fire was also a significant element in his personal history: when he was 21, he lost his left hand while making fireworks to celebrate Mexico\u2019s Independence Day. In the mural, Prometheus\u2019s right hand appears consumed by the flame, possibly signifying the artist\u2019s loss.\n\nThe two side panels were designed by the artists but were painted in part by his assistant Jorge Juan Crespo de la Serna. The panel on the west wall, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/destruction-of-mythology-study-1930][i]Destruction of Mythology[/i][/url] shows the Greek gods Zeus, Hera and Io, whose gaze is frightened and concentrated on Prometheus. The panel on the east wall, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/strangulation-of-mythology-study-1930][i]Strangulation of Mythology[/i][/url] depicts male and female centaurs, the female centaur is caught in the coils of a giant serpent, while her infant throws his arms towards her. According to Orozco, the side panels represent \u201cthe ancient times that Prometheus is upsetting by giving the fire of knowledge to man\u201d.\n\nPrometheus holds a significant place in Orozco\u2019s artistic development, and more broadly in the history of mural painting. Orozco joined the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/muralism]Muralism[/url] in 1923, and several of his early murals anticipate the motifs in [i]Prometheus[/i]. Even in his early experiments with fresco, Orozco painted giant muscular figures against a background of sun-like symbols. An example of this is the mural [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/omnisciencia-1925][i]Omniciencia[/i][/url] (1925) that deals with the theme of creation \u2013 in the central composition, a muscular female figure is kneeling clasping her hands upwards to receive the gift of fire. Like in [i]Prometheus[/i], the kneeling pose is positioned on the central axis in the composition. Additionally, there are similarities in the radiating motifs behind the central figures in the two murals. \n\nThe Muralism movement was led by [i]Los Tres Grandes[/i], the three great Mexican muralists: Orozco, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Diego Rivera[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/david-alfaro-siqueiros]David Alfaro Siqueiros[/url]. [i]Prometheus[/i] was the first major mural painted in the United States by one of these three artists. The mural received acclaim almost immediately after its completion, it was praised by critics and the architect of Fray Hall, Sumner Spaulding. Later, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism]abstract expressionist[/url] painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jackson-pollock]Jackson Pollock[/url] stated it was \u201cthe greatest painting in North America\u201d."

Surviving documents suggest that, for a brief period before she married, the future artist did factory work in Troy.\r\nA massive fire in Troy two years after Moses' birth clearly figured prominently in local lore. Moses cut out and saved a commemorative news clipping, published in 1939, and used it as the basis for a series of paintings. The artist's pencil notations on the clipping indicate how she proposed to modify the vignette. The Burning of Troy in 1862, the fifth version she did of the subject, is already quite far removed from the clipping.\r\nConventional illustration tends to focus on foreground or background, but seldom on both at once. Combining these two views was one hallmark of the \"Grandma Moses\" style. Thus, in The Burning of Troy Moses has considerably expanded the scene beyond the burning bridge, including more foreground as well as a detailed rendering of the city in the background."

The painting is set on the red foliage of the chestnut tree moved by the wind, which organizes the space by cradling the gaze between the soft slopes and the central plateau to direct it into depth, where it is lost beyond the short horizon. A small figure of a peasant woman, bent over the path that descends irregularly among the vegetation on the right, is barely identifiable in the purple shadow, merged into the landscape of which it is an inseparable part as well as the leaves and branches, rocks and shrubs, in peaceful harmony with the cyclical and inevitable flow of the seasons. Pellizza uses a warm palette to recreate the seductive colors of late October, however lit up by the cold blue of the sky streaked with white clouds in a bold game of dissonances. The frayed brushstroke punctuates the earth with green and orange transparencies, modulating the backlight effects to simulate the vibration of the foliage, while above it suggests the movements of the crisp air with lilac and blue notches that chase each other and overlap in a mosaic of throbbing lights . In the painting Pellizza achieves the desired synthesis between the solid structure of the whole, truly meditated with the constant exercise of drawing, and the absolute mobility of the lights, which does not destroy the volumes but confirms them, achieved with a divisionism capable of overcoming every rigidity and evoke a lyrical, dreamy and enchanted world, beyond appearances."

        "description": "The mural [i]Catharsis[/i] (1934) decorates the walls of the Palace of Fine Art in Mexico City. Orozco presents there a dystopian vision of humanity, plagued by conflict, decay, and destruction. In particular, he highlights a world ravaged by industrialization and war: the backdrop is a chaotic scene of agitated protesters, men engaging in combat among piles of cogwheels, weapons, and machinery. The most prominent figure is the laughing prostituted woman, provocatively lying on her back left of the center of the mural. Orozco also incorporates disembodied heads of other prostituted women in the foreground, their grimacing faces are painted with garish makeup.\n\nThe incorporation of prostituted women in a public commission for a prominent cultural institution reflects the multiple layers of Orozco\u2019s social and political critique in [i]Catharsis[/i]. In the context of European literary and artistic avant-garde, the figure of the prostituted woman is a motif that represents the female body as both an object of male desire and a commodity. The motif embodied the temporal nature and commodified social relations that characterized the experience of modernity and industrialization. This interpretation is supported by some of Orozco\u2019s preparatory sketches, in which the prostitute\u2019s head resembles a bag of coins suggesting that the figure represents the ultimate commodity fetish.\n\n[i]Catharsis[/i] was the first public fresco the artist created after his seven yearlong stay in the United States, and it presented Orozco\u2019s artistic development during his time abroad. The mural reflects the artist\u2019s time in New York: he was influenced by the city\u2019s architecture, for instance, the collapsed steel girder resembles a Manhattan skyscraper. Some have suggested that cinema was another inspiration for [i]Catharsis[/i], specifically the German expressionist film [i]Metropolis[/i] (1927) directed by Fritz Lang \u2013 a film Orozco saw while he was living in New York. [i]Catharsis[/i] shares aesthetic and thematic similarities with Lang\u2019s film: [i]Metropolis[/i] also presents dystopian modernity that reveals anxieties relating to technology and mass uprisings. While Lang\u2019s film reconciles the conflicts of capital and labor, Catharsis does not offer a potential solution. Instead, Orozco demonstrates his skeptical attitude toward technological developments and mass mobilization.\n\nIt is possible that the figure of the prostituted woman was inspired by the robot Maria in [i]Metropolis[/i]. In the film, the robotic Maria uses her sexuality to inspire an uprising and is later burned at the stake by the same masses. Therefore, Maria is also a signifier of the rioting mob. Accordingly, the prostituted woman in [i]Catharsis[/i] can also be interpreted as a symbol of Mexico\u2019s ten-year revolution \u2013 events that the artist experienced and chronicled firsthand. Orozco was deeply critical of the new political regime in post-revolutionary Mexico; thus, the figure of the prostituted woman can be understood as a defiled symbol of corruption. This was a common trope, political satirists in opposition papers often used the administration\u2019s social and economic links to 'high-class prostitutes' to expose their misconduct and corruption. For Orozco, the mural was an opportunity to condemn the hypocrisy and of the ruling regime in a public space in front of a national audience."

        "description": "[i]The Little Street[/i] by Jan Vermeer depicts a small fragment of Delft, his hometown and place of residence. The small painting (54.3x44 cm) is a significant piece in Vermeer\u2019s body of work. Besides the famous [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/view-on-delft][i]View on Delft[/i][/url] (ca. 1660-1661), [i]The Little Street[/i] is the only other recognized [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/cityscape#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]townscape[/url] created by Vermeer. Although there are records of another townscape painted by Vermeer, it remains unknown and lost. Just like Vermeer\u2019s famous interiors, [i]The Little Street[/i] embodies qualities of intimacy and domesticity. The artist shows the beauty found in the mundane, the figures of women and children going about their daily activities. The women diligently cleaning and doing needlework in front of the simple households represent the ideal of domestic virtue. The vine growing on the building on the left also relates to domesticity, as it was considered a symbol of love, fidelity and marriage since ancient times.\n\nThe subject was possibly inspired by the art of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-de-hooch]Pieter De Hooch[/url]\u2019s, paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-de-hooch/a-dutch-courtyard][i]A Dutch Courtyard [/i][/url] (ca. 1658) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-de-hooch/courtyard-of-a-house-in-delft-1658][i]Courtyard of a House in Delft[/i][/url] (1658). De Hooch, a Dutch Golden Age painter, was Vermeer\u2019s contemporary and a member of the Delft [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/guild-of-saint-luke#!#resultType:masonry]Guild of Saint Luke[/url]. Since both resided in Delft, it is very possible that the two were familiar with each other\u2019s work, as they share similar qualities in terms of approach and technique. An interesting aspect in Pieter De Hooch art was his tendency to combine architectural elements from a variety of sources to compose new spatial arrangements. Even though these were imaginary constructions, De Hooch was successful in making them compelling and realistic. Like De Hooch, Vermeer presumably made similar adjustments in [i]The Little Street[/i] in order to create a more interesting composition. For instance, the doorway in which the woman sits doing handwork, should be aligned with the center of the building and at an equal distance from the two sets of windows. Vermeer ignored this in order to include the red shutter and part of the window, which gave a sense of completion and balance to the composition. In addition, it has been speculated that Vermeer joined the two buildings that were in fact separated.\n\nOver the years, many art historians tried to identify the actual location portrayed in Vermeer\u2019s painting, but no consensus was reached. Recently, new research presented evidence that the location is Vlamingstraat in Delft, more precisely present day numbers 40 and 42. The identification was made based on archival study of the quay dues register from 1667. The register contained detailed accounts of the width of all the houses and passageways that lined Delft\u2019s canals in Vermeer\u2019s time. Presently, the only recognizable element from Vermeer\u2019s painting is the small passageway leading to a courtyard or garden. It was also discovered that the house on the right belonged to Vermeer\u2019s widowed aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne. In addition, it is known that Vermeer\u2019s mother and sister lived on the same canal. Therefore, [i]The Little Street[/i] possibly had another dimension because the artist might have had personal memories associated with the location."

One of the best-known images of 20th-century art, the painting depicts an all-night diner in which three customers, all lost in their own thoughts, have congregated. Fluorescent lights had just come into use in the early 1940s, and the all-night diner emits an eerie glow, like a beacon on the dark street corner. Hopper eliminated any reference to an entrance, and the viewer, drawn to the light, is shut out from the scene by a seamless wedge of glass. The four anonymous and uncommunicative night owls seem as separate and remote from the viewer as they are from one another. Reworked and parodied countless times, Nighthawks has become an icon of American culture."

Both his drawing and painting that followed depict the war-torn Western Front, where the trees have been burned or beaten away and the earth has become scarred and undulated by shell holes. There are no people, but the tree stumps have an eerie human presence. Indeed, the trees are either personified or they stand as gravestones for the men no longer standing there themselves.\n\nDespite a tone of pessimism and a scene wrought with destruction, the sun beats down and continues to illuminate this land. This light works on two levels; it shows a glimmer of hope that Nash cannot let go of, but also introduces a tone of mockery with regards the purpose and intent of war. The latter rings particularly true when considered in respect to the title of the work - [i]We are making a new world[/i] - which acts both as a parody of the naive ambitions of war and as a description of how the landscape has been subjected to such destruction that it is almost unrecognizable. A former curator at The Imperial War Museum, Roger Tolson, affirms \"In Nash's bitter vision the sun will continue to rise each and every day to expose the desecration and to repeat judgment on the perpetrators. This new world is unwanted, unlovable but inescapable.\"\n\nThis work is generally considered to be one of the most memorable images of the First World War and has been compared to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/guernica-1937]Picasso's [i]Guernica[/i][/url] (1937) - the Spanish Master's legendary response to the bombing of the eponymous town. Nash poignantly subverts the usually peaceful and picturesque English landscape tradition and introduces a new element of horror. As such, the painting well embodies his comments of the previous year with respect to his role as a war artist: \"I am a messenger who will bring back word from men fighting to those who want the war to last forever.\" This message, he claimed, would reveal the \"bitter truth\" of war.\n\n[url href=https://www.theartstory.org/artist/nash-paul/artworks/][b]by TheArtStory[/b][/url]"

Although the viewer looks uptown toward Madison Square from the intersection of Broadway and 23rd Street, Bellows did not intend to represent a specific, identifiable place in the city. He instead drew on several bustling commercial districts to create an imaginary composite, an impossibly crowded image that would best convey a sense of the city\u2019s frenetic pace.\n\nBy assembling all of these diverse elements into one scene, Bellows revolutionized the conventions of the traditional American urban vista and surpassed the efforts of other contemporary urban realists, like Robert Henri (American, 1865 - 1929) and John Sloan (American, 1871 - 1951). A critic commented that New York is full of \u201cmotion, of stirring existence. Trucks are darting through the crowd. Men and women are hurrying across the streets, trolleys are clanging their way in and out, a policeman is keeping people from being run over, you feel the rush, you hear the noise, and you wish you were safely home.\u201d"

Other landscapes by Bruegel, for example The Hunters in the Snow (1565) and others in that series of paintings showing the seasons, show genre figures in a raised foreground, but not so large relative to the size of the image, nor with a subject from a \"higher\" class of painting in the background."

Because Benois was also a costume designer, he was able to illustrate what the dancers should look like in the sets, as well as what the sets would look like themselves.

        "description": "Salvador Dali's painting, The Burning Giraffe, epitomises the surrealist style of painting he was renowned for.\n\nThe emergence of psychoanalysis and the work of Sigmund Freud were major influences on the artist, along with the cubist output of Picasso and the work of other surrealists, such as, Miro and classical painters,including Vermeer and Velazquez.\n\nThose coming to Dali for the first time, most typically through the coloured plates in art books, are often surprised to find that the actual canvases and boards he committed his work to are much smaller than imagined. The Burning Giraffe is one such example.\n\nThe work dates from 1937 when Dali was 34 years old. It was painted in Spain, with oils on board, prior to Dali\u2019s American sojourn in the early 1940s. The painting measures 35cm X 27cm and is currently housed in the Kunstmuseum in Basel Switzerland.\n\nIn 1937, Spain was in the grip of a bloody civil war and the painting is thought to represent both the insecurities the artist felt about that conflict, his struggles with his own country and his own deeper subconscious world of dreams, and perceptions. It is full of images that act almost as motifs which recur frequently in Dali\u2019s work.\n\nIt is interesting that the title of the painting is The Burning Giraffe because this image, which is much smaller than the two female forms in the foreground, can only be seen, almost in relief, at the back of the picture as the eye moves back towards the horizon.\n\nDali first used the image of a burning Giraffe, which he called the masculine cosmic apocalyptic monster, in the film L\u2019 Age d \u2018Or (the Golden Age) which he made in collaboration with Luis Bunuel in 1930.\n\nThe image recurs again in a much later (1975) work in pastel and water colour, Burning Giraffes in Brown, also known as Giraffe Avignon. For many, the Giraffe works for Dali as a totem animal with the burning Giraffe seen as a premonition of war; whilst fire is representative of a dangerous death, imbued with meaning.\n\nThe breaking up of the female form and mystification surrounding female sexuality, combined with fetishism are themes common to Dali. Here the two main figures are clearly female, but they appear in almost skeletal form as what Dali called, the tail bone woman.\n\nThe skin appears to be peeling, exposing what lies beneath, hidden, one of the main ideas conveyed in this work. The figures stand in isolation from each other and from the rest of the painting, in a dream landscape which the artist has created by exceptional use of colour.\n\nThe figures are featureless, deprived of sight or hearing but the figure in the foreground is reaching out for something, perhaps symbolic of the position women had reached on their journey towards equality.\n\nThe drawer that opens out of the thorax, together with the seven small drawers that open from the left leg of the principle figure, make what Dali referred to as the anthropomorphic cabinet. This takes us back to Freud and the secret drawers in the human psyche which can only be opened through psychoanalysis.\n\nFrom Dali's perspective this was about suppression of the inner and subconscious life, and the taming of inner beast.\n\nWomen are objectified and desired and this is repressed and the true self is hidden away because these things are not socially acceptable. And yet, Dali was aware of what he called, the narcissistic smells coming from the drawers which made it almost impossible to resist opening them.\n\nUndefined shapes eminate from the backs of both of the female forms. Could these shapes be yet another of Dali\u2019s favourite artistic devices, melting clocks, or soft watches as seen in perhaps his most famous work, The Persistence of Memory (1931)?\n\nThe smaller figure holds what appears to be a piece of flesh in her hand, a device also present in The Great Masturbator (1929). Raw meat is seen as the call for a return to primitive nature, a rediscovery of the inner being.\n\nBoth female forms are supported by crutches, yet another of Dali\u2019s common motifs seen in many of his works, but perhaps best utilised in Sleep (1937) and less so in The Ghost of Vermeer of Delft Which Can Be Used As a Table (1934).\n\nIn The Burning Giraffe, the crutches are clearly masculine in nature, representing a patriarchal system which many believed women would be helpless without. They are phallic in essence, male dominance over the bodies of women."

        "description": "The Scream is the best known and most frequently reproduced of all Munch\u2019s motifs. With its expressive colours, its flowing lines and striking overall effect, its appeal is universal.\r\n\r\nDespite radical simplification, the landscape in the picture is recognisable as the Kristiania Fjord seen from Ekeberg, with a broad view over the fjord, the town and the hills beyond. In the background to the left, at the end of the path with the balustrade that cuts diagonally across the picture, we see two strolling figures, often regarded as two friends whom Munch mentions in notes relating to the picture. But the figure in the foreground is the first to capture the viewer\u2019s attention. Its hands are held to its head and its mouth is wide open in a silent scream, which is amplified by the undulating movement running through the surrounding landscape. The figure is ambiguous and it is hard to say whether it is a man or a woman, young or old \u2013 or even if it is human at all.\r\n\r\nAs with many of Munch\u2019s pictures, it is assumed that here as well his starting point was private feelings and experience. His diaries contain several remarks that seem to form a background to this depiction of existential angst, among them the following: \u201cI was walking along the road with two friends \u2013 Then the sun went down \u2013 The sky suddenly turned to blood and I felt a great scream in nature \u2013\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe Scream was first exhibited at Munch\u2019s solo exhibition in Berlin in 1893. It was a central element in \u201cThe Frieze of Life\u201d, and has been the theme of probing analysis and many suggested interpretations. The painting also exists in a later version, which is in the possession of the Munch Museum. In addition Munch worked with the motif in drawings, pastels and prints.\r\n"

For much of its history, the painting was covered with a thick layer of varnish, giving the impression that it was a night scene, hence the name. The varnish was removed in 1940, revealing the bright colors of the painting. The painting has also suffered damage at the hand of art dealers, who in 1715 cut the painting down on three side on order to fit it between two columns, and vandals, who have purposely tried to ruin the painting. In 1975, an unemployed school teacher attacked the work, leaving a large section of zig-zags scratches. The painting was successfully restored, although the scratches are still somewhat visible. In 1990, the painting was attacked again, by a man who threw acid on the canvas. The acid was quickly neutralized, however, and the painting was saved. "

        "description": "\u201dIn The Miner, Carlos Orozco Romero sought an opportunity for formal experimentation. The earthy palette evokes a subterranean landscape. The figure of the miner pushing his wheelbarrow dominates the composition, balancing the angular geometric forms: a brick wall, smoke stack, a rectangular building with an arched doorway, and a conical mountain that looms in the distance. Manmade forms create a pattern of alternating diagonals in the background. Orozco Romero\u2019s treatment of the subject defies the political rhetoric of the 1920s and later, in which the suffering of the worker was often emphasized. Executed shortly after he moved permanently to Mexico City, the subject of this oil was surely inspired by the monumental works he encountered there. But whereas Rivera, in his murals in the Patio of Labor at the Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica, showcased the martyrdom of the miner, Orozco Romero created a dynamic composition whose main purpose was to juxtapose the softened human form with the angularity of the emerging industrial landscape.

A mural was commissioned for the new town hall, which served as a seasonal allegory and a political statement. The work's lush hues and signature flatness create a distorted hierarchy of figures and a dream-like composition of a different era, with background figures gradually decreasing in size according to the laws of perspective and dimension. This technique was later adopted by artists such as Georges Seurat, Pablo Picasso, and Paul Gauguin. However, while the painting portrays an idealized summer scene with bathers, it lacks a clear narrative or objective.\n\nThe choice of summer and water as a decorative theme for the new town hall was symbolic of a remedy for the bitter winter of 1870 under the Franco-Prussian war and the burning of the old town hall in 1871. Even in 1891, these events were still fresh in people's minds. By depicting a fantasy rather than recent history, Puvis transports the audience back to a classical and more peaceful time."

        "description": "Long considered to be by Rembrandt, and widely published as such, this picture was first identified as the work of Jan Lievens by Abraham Bredius in 1911 (see Literature).  It dates from circa 1629, when both Rembrandt and Lievens, together in Leiden, painted numerous such studies of old men and women, of which the subject can be said to be old age itself.  The evidence for dating this and similar works by both artists to this brief period is considerable, but in the case of Lievens, a study of an aged Capuchin monk in the collection of the Marquess of Lothian, Monteviot, signed and dated 1629, provides a key comparison.1\n\nBoth Rembrandt and Lievens, and sometimes other artists in their close Leiden circle, often used the same model for different studies - the most famous of these is the old woman popularly known as \"Rembrandt's mother\".  Lievens made another study of the same bearded ancient portrayed here, seen from the same angle, but hatless, in the Herzog-Anton-Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig (see fig. 1).2  He used the same model in his depiction of The Apostle Paul writing to the Thessalonians, now in the Kunsthalle, Bremen.3  Rembrandt also used the same model in his painting of Two Old Men Disputing, possibly Saints Peter and Paul, in Melbourne, National Gallery of Victoria, dating from 1628 (detail here reproduced fig. 2).4    It is possible that Rembrandt's painting of Jeremiah lamenting the destruction of Jerusalem, circa 1630, in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, uses the same model, who has the same distinctive nose with a bulbous bridge, but Jeremiah's head is seen at a steep angle from above, and the identification must remain speculative.\n\nThe fanciful studies from life, often exotically costumed, that Rembrandt, Lievens and their followers painted in large numbers, are not portraits as such and are known as tronies, the term for them that was in use at least by 1630.  Those depicting old bearded men are sometimes known generically as prophets: here old age is associated with wisdom, not folly.  Constantijn Huygens' autobiographical account of 1629-31 records that a number of Lievens' tronies had already found their way into prominent collections, including those of the Stadholder Prince Frederik Hendrik, his treasurer, Thomas Brouart, the artist Jacques de Gheyn III, and the Amsterdam tax collector Nicolaas Sohier.5  Huygens continues: \"There are works of inestimable value and unrivalled artistry.  May their maker be preserved for us in the length of days\".6\n\nRembrandt and Lievens' outburst of intense activity in the last years of the 1620s has been much commented on.  Clearly, both artists knew each other very well, were rivals, but influenced and perhaps taught each other, and both were becoming aware of their own potential.  With wisdom of hindsight, it seems to us that bereft of Rembrandt's influence, Lievens' subsequent work lacked direction and his career faltered, but without wisdom of hindsight, there is little evidence to determine in the febrile years of 1628-9 which would be the greater artist.  In his manuscript autobiography, written in 1629 when he was only 33 years old, Constantijn Huygens, secretary to the Stadholder Frederik Hendrik, one of the most exceptional figures of the Dutch 17th Century, and by the late 1620s already one of the most influential figures in the cultural life of the Netherlands, wrote extensively about Lievens and Rembrandt, whom he bracketed together.  Huygens knew both painters and had presumably visited them in Leiden in 1628.   Lievens' portrait of him, painted in 1629, is in the Mus\u00e9e de la Chartreuse, Douai, and Rembrandt's portrait is in the Dulwich Art Gallery.  Huygens' famous observation that neither artist found it necessary to spend a few months on a tour of Italy \u2013 despite he and others exhorting them to go \u2013 was qualified in his own following paragraph: \"they claim to be in the bloom of youth and wish to profit from it; they have no time to waste on distant travel\".  He goes on to add, in a passage that might falsely appear to the modern reader to have been written to explain both painters' obsessive interest in the depiction of the physical and psychological nature of old age in pictures such as the present one:  \"I feel it incumbent upon me to state that I have never observed such dedication and persistence in other men, whatever their pursuits or ages.  Truly, these youths are redeeming the time ... That is their sole consideration.  Most amazingly, they regard even the most innocent diversions of youth as a waste of time, as if they were already old men burdened with age and long past such follies.  Such indefatigable application to diligent labour may well yield great results quickly...\".7  \n\nA modern analysis of what distinguished the two painters might not accord with Huygens' subsequent thumbnail sketch of each.  He characterizes Lievens for his grandeur in conception and his daring of subjects and forms; he probably had works from a year or two earlier in mind, since his description matches Lievens' paintings of 1625-7.  The present picture, on the other hand, which is highly characteristic of Lievens' production at the end of the decade, is contemplative in its character and modest in its scale and scope; it strives for a depth of understanding of the character of the sitter and the nature of his condition through a very detailed depiction of his physical state, albeit painted with an unhesitating virtuousity.  His left eye is reddish and the muscles of his left cheek are slack, suggesting that he might have had a stroke.  Its concentration, sensitivity, and absence of grandiosity and pretension, and these characteristics in other of his works at the end of the decade, suggest the question: did Lievens respond to Huygens' criticisms of him by adopting more of how Huygens characterised Rembrandt's approach to painting?  Huygens did admire Lievens' abilities as a portraitist when he wrote: \"in painting the human countenance he wreaks miracles\".\n\nBoth Lievens and Rembrandt painted in a remarkably similar way at this date.  Both worked extensively with the handle of the brush into the wet paint, a technique that does not easily allow for cautious working or revision, since it depends on the malleable consistency of the un-dried paint.  This can easily be seen in the present work, for example in the beard.  Both painters favoured strong diagonal lighting, so that here the left hand part of the sitter's face is in strong direct light, the area between the nose and his left cheekbone partly lit, and the remaining left cheek and temples, and the side of the nose in full shadow, painted in half-tones, using strong reddish-brown pigments.  Both artists, and Rembrandt's pupil Gerrit Dou, painted studies of single figures that are not formal portraits in 1627-30, but on the whole Lievens' studies, like the present work, are on larger panels, and with the exception of Rembrandt's self-portraits, are on a larger scale, filling the greater portion of the painted surface.\n\nSeveral copies of this picture are known: Schneider mentions one with the dealer Denekamp, Scheveningen; Ekkart/Schneider thinks this is probably the same copy that was later in an auction in The Hague, Pulchri Studio, 10 March 1959, lot 128, and then with F.H. Enneking, Amsterdam, and identifies a further copy, with J. Gans, The Hague, 1938 and 1959.8\n\n1.  See Sumowski under Literature, 1983, p. 1795, no. 1238, reproduced p. 1877.\n2.

The title, A Park at Night gives a vague sense of the surroundings. But the place remains unclear. Is it Paris or some other town? The cast-iron lamp posts argue for Paris. The recurring motif of the tree trunks gives the pastel an uneasy feeling, because like ghosts they are vertical and vaporous. This theme of vague anxiety can be compared with the atmosphere often described by the Belgian symbolists."

        "description": "''Grande Odalisque'', also known as ''Une Odalisque or La Grande Odalisque'', completed in 1814, is a Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres oil painting depicting an odalisque or concubine. It is currently housed in the Louvre, Paris.\n\nThe painting was commissioned by Napoleon's sister, Queen Caroline Murat of Naples. Ingres drew for inspiration upon such works as Dresden Venus by Giorgione, and Titian's Venus of Urbino, though the actual pose of a reclining figure looking back over her shoulder is directly drawn from the 1809 Portrait of Madame R\u00e9camier by Jacques-Louis David. The small head, elongated limbs, and cool color scheme all reveal influences from Mannerists such as Parmigianino, whose Madonna with the Long Neck was also well known for its anatomical distortion.\n\nThis eclectic mix of styles, combining classical form with Romantic themes, prompted harsh criticism when it was first shown in 1814. Ingres' contemporaries believed it marked Ingres' break from Neoclassicism, indicating a shift toward exotic Romanticism. Ingres' critics viewed him as a rebel against the contemporary style of form and content. When the painting was first shown in the Salon of 1819, a critic remarked that the work had \"neither bones nor muscle, neither blood, nor life, nor relief, indeed nothing that constitutes imitation\". This echoed the general view that Ingres had disregarded anatomical realism. Ingres instead favored long lines to convey curvature and sensuality, as well as abundant even light to tone down the volume. Ingres continued to be attacked for his work until the mid-1820s.\n\nStemming from the initial criticism the painting received, the figure in Grande Odalisque is thought to be drawn with \"two or three vertebrae too many.\" Critics at the time believed the elongations to be errors on the part of Ingres, but recent studies show the elongations to have been deliberate. Measurements taken on the proportions of real women showed that Ingres's figure was drawn with a curvature of the spine and rotation of the pelvis impossible to replicate. It also showed the left arm of the odalisque is shorter than the right. The study concluded that the figure was longer by five instead of two or three vertebrae and that the excess affected the lengths of the pelvis and lower back instead of merely the lumbar region.\n\nGiven how the duty of concubines was merely to satisfy the carnal pleasures of the sultan, this elongation of her pelvic area may have been a symbolic distortion by Ingres. While this may represent sensuous feminine beauty, her gaze, on the other hand, has been said to \"[reflect] a complex psychological make-up\" or \"[betray] no feeling\". In addition, the distance between her gaze and her pelvic region may be a physical representation of the depth of thought and complex emotions of a woman's thoughts and feelings."

Heade married in 1883 and settled in St. Augustine, Florida after a lackluster career as an itinerant artist. He was patronized by Floridian Henry Morrison Flagler, an oil and railroad magnate, who regularly purchased his works. The NGA believes this personal and professional stability stimulated the production of the still-life paintings of Heade's last years.\r\n\r\nThe NGA writes, \"Certainly works such as Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth, with their striking contrasts of brilliantly lit flowers and leaves set against a dark background, are among the most original still lifes of the nineteenth century. They are also for many observers strongly sensual, their lush colors, full, curving contours, overall sense of opulence, and implied perfumed scent of the flowers suggestive, perhaps, of female nudes languidly reclining on luxurious couches.\""

        "description": "This most famous and influential [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/neo-impressionism]Neo-Impressionist[/url] work depicts a cross-section of Paris society enjoying a Sunday afternoon in the park on an island in the Seine River just at the gates of Paris. Sunday was the time that middle-class Parisians escaped the city to enjoy the outdoors. The people primarily gather in small groups of two or three or sit alone in proximity to others. It is the relationship between these people that creates a sense of modernity, with its distance and disconnection, and nervous tension that lends the work an air of mystery.\n\nUsing a grid system and applying small dots of paint, Seurat took two years to complete this large-scale painting. He went to the park often, observing and making over 60 preliminary studies, including 15 in oil. Invoking Greek classical art, Seurat explained, \"The Panathenaeans of Phidias formed a procession. I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color.\" Seurat hoped to capture the permanence, or essential forms, behind the fleeting moments. Everyone here is caught in a still pose, except for the child in the orange dress skipping off into the trees, the man on the far left playing trombone, and the furious little dog at the lower right. However, it seems a stillness that might burst into movement at any moment, just as the upper half of the painting moves into the sunlight and the boats in the distance cut across the river. While Seurat invoked classical and Egyptian figures, some have interpreted the overall static effect of the composition and the stiffness of the poses as a critique of the artificiality of modern society and the boredom of middle-class life."

Painted in 1922, this nocturnal vista of Lower Manhattan, seen from the roof of his Greenwich Village studio, is regarded as the culmination of Sloan\u2019s city scenes. In his own description of the picture, Sloan stated that it \u201cmakes a record of the beauty of the older city which is giving way to the chopped-out towers of the modern New York.\u201d Sloan has commented on the artifice of the modern city by including the Moonshine advertisement on a building at the lower left. This fictional brand is a reference to the illicitly distilled and distributed liquor that was popular during Prohibition. The truncated moon graphic evokes what the city\u2019s artificial electric lighting so effectively obscures: natural moonlight. Despite Sloan\u2019s critical attitude toward urban modernization, the painting possesses a magical quality, as one looks over the elevated train tracks on Greenwich Village\u2019s lower Sixth Avenue toward the eerily illuminated skyscrapers\u2014the Woolworth Building and Singer Tower\u2014on the horizon."

C\u00e9zanne began to paint in the area around 1900, finding numerous motifs in the dense woods on the grounds of the estate, for example: Trees and Rocks in the Park of the Ch\u00e2teau Noir, c. 1904. The house, in its decrepit isolation, inspired some of the artist\u2019s most foreboding images. The eerie structure seen in Ch\u00e2teau Noir, 1900\u20131904, seemingly in ruins, is half-hidden behind pines that, like the rocks of Bib\u00e9mus, almost obstruct the sky. C\u00e9zanne\u2019s saturated palette\u2014dark greens, blues and ochers\u2014makes the scene all the more powerful. The somber, enclosed spaces of the paintings of the Ch\u00e2teau Noir and the Bib\u00e9mus quarry count among his most emotionally profound pictures and are indicative of a decided melancholy that pervades C\u00e9zanne\u2019s work in his last decade. By this time, suffering from diabetes, the artist had become obsessed with the reality of his own mortality."

        "description": "[i]A Modern Olympia[/i] (1874) by Paul C\u00e9zanne was an homage to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]\u00c9douard Manet[/url]\u2019s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863][i]Olympia[/i][/url] (1863) that caused a great scandal when it was first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon. Manet\u2019s Olympia shows a nude woman lying on the bed while a servant brings her flowers. It was modeled after the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/venus-of-urbino-1538][i]Venus of Urbino[/i][/url] (ca. 1534) by [url href=www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]. However, Manet\u2019s [i]Olympia[/i] was not a Roman goddess, and a contemporary audience was able to unequivocally identify her as a prostituted woman. In the 19th century Paris \u2018Olympia\u2019 was a slang word for 'prostitute', and Manet revealed his model\u2019s identity through several details in the painting: the contemporary accessories symbolized wealth and sensuality, the black cat was a symbol of prostitution and above all the gaze of the model confronted the viewer directly. The painting broke with academic tradition and convention by rejecting the idealized nude that represented historical or mythical figures. Despite the controversy, [i]Olympia[/i] was greatly admired by artists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet]Claude Monet[/url] and Paul C\u00e9zanne, as well as by writer \u00c9mile Zola.\n\nThe idea for [i]A Modern Olympia[/i] came about during C\u00e9zanne\u2019s stay with Doctor Paul Gachet at Auvers-sur-Oise. C\u00e9zanne had a burst of inspiration amid a heated discussion, during which he sketched out the adaptation of Manet\u2019s painting. In the painting, C\u00e9zanne used luminous and bright colors and was painted in an [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/impressionism]Impressionist[/url] manner. C\u00e9zanne\u2019s interpretation [i]A Modern Olympia[/i] was exhibited in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874 and was poorly received by both the public and critics. In an art review, critic Marc de Montifaud wrote: \u201clike a voluptuous vision, this artificial corner of paradise has left even the most courageous gasping for breath \u2026 and Mr. C\u00e9zanne merely gives the impression of being a sort of madman, painting in a state of delirium tremens\u201d. \n\nEven though C\u00e9zanne included all the main elements of Manet\u2019s painting, the nude woman, a black servant, a curtain, a large bouquet of flowers, and a small pet, the result was very different. C\u00e9zanne also made an important addition to the composition, a male figure reclining on the couch dressed in black, elegant attire. By restaging the scene C\u00e9zanne made it more explicit: the black maid uncovers the nude woman like in peep show designed for the client, the man on the couch. The gesture of the reveal is reminiscent of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-leon-gerome]Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-leon-gerome/phryne-before-the-areopagus-1861][i]Phryne before the Areopagus[/i][/url] (1861), a painting that depicts the trial of Phryne, a legendary courtesan from ancient Greece. Another important difference was in C\u00e9zanne\u2019s depiction of Olympia: lying on the bed in a crouched pose, she has no recognizable facial features or characteristics. Painted crudely, C\u00e9zanne\u2019s \u2018modern Olympia\u2019 is an archetypal figure, that does not possess the erotic appeal of Manet\u2019s female nude. The erotic quality of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s painting comes from the unseemly activity he explicitly depicts, rather than the sensuous flesh of the naked woman. C\u00e9zanne\u2019s painting is theatrical, the curtain on the left side makes the scene appear like a moment captured on the stage. Today, [i]Olympia[/i] and [i]A Modern Olympia[/i] both belong to the collection of Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris."

He made two versions, the first in 1802-03 and the second, more elaborate one, in 1805; only the later work survives. Like Friedrich's Tetschen 'altarpiece', it had an elaborate frame - in this case a painted frame-within-a-frame that was to be read as part of the work. Its various motifs - twining plants, oak leaves and small children - function as hieroglyphs, supporting the allegory. Though it was certainly not what would normally be understood as a landscape, it was based on an aspect of the natural world - one heard, not seen. One will look in vain for a nightingale in it, and it is immediately clear that this is a metaphorical equation of the idea of the young songbird with the human child.\n\nRunge took his subject from an ode by the poet Friedrich Klopstock, in which Psyche - the female personification of the soul, shown as is usual with butterfly wings - instructs Cupid (Love) in song in an oakwood at evening, as the nightingales begin to sing; thus the theme is interwoven with the sound of birdsong."

        "description": "[i]Saint Cecilia[/i] (1895) was painted at the height of Waterhouse\u2019s career and was first exhibited in 1895 at the Royal Academy in London. It received great praise from critics, and later that year Waterhouse got the full membership of the Royal Academy. The painting depicts Saint Cecilia, a Roman virgin martyr who lived in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. Cecilia was raised as a Christian and took a vow of chastity. She married a Roman nobleman named Valerius, who she persuaded to accept sexual abstinence by allowing him to see her guardian angel. The angel descended from the heavens and placed garlands of lilies and roses on their heads. After the revelation, Valerius and his brother were baptized. All three of them died as martyrs.\n\nIn Christian iconography, Cecilia is the patron saint of music. The connection to music relates to the early accounts of Cecilia\u2019s life. According to these, Cecilia did not want to hear musical instruments because she wanted to remain pure to be able to hear heavenly music. [i]Saint Cecilia[/i] is based on a verse from Alfred Tennyson\u2019s poem: 'In a clear walled city on the sea, Near gilded organ pipes... ...slept St Cecily\u2019. Tennyson\u2019s poems often served as an inspiration to Waterhouse. The best-known examples are Waterhouse\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/Search/the%20Lady%20of%20Shalott%20waterhouse]three paintings[/url] of the legend of Lady of Shalott that were inspired by different verses from Tennyson\u2019s 1832 poem [i]The Lady Shalott[/i].\n\nWaterhouse depicts Saint Cecilia sitting in a garden overlooking the sea. She has fallen asleep and two youthful angels serenade her with a violin and a rebec. Waterhouse weaves different symbols into the composition. For example, the roses in the walled garden refer to the rose garland that the angels placed on Cecilia\u2019s head. The other flower in the garden is the poppy \u2013 a well-known symbol of sleep and serenity. Waterhouse tried to emulate the historic setting of Saint Cecilia\u2019s life, likely by using images of Roman antiquity available in books and museums. At the same time, the setting is also reminiscent of the Florentine landscape depicted in Renaissance paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci]Leonardo Da Vinci[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/annunciation][i]Annunciation[/i][/url] (c. 1472). The focal point of the painting is Saint Cecilia. Like many Victorian artists, Waterhouse adopted the pose of the reclining female figure, which also expressed the continuing interest in classical sculpture and antiquity. The reclining pose was used by Waterhouse\u2019s in different paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/ophelia-1889][i]Ophelia[/i][/url] (1889) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/ariadne-1898][i]Ariadne[/i][/url] (1898). Some have suggested that the choice of pose was also influenced by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-burne-jones]Edward Burne-Jones[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-burne-jones/all-works#!#filterName:Series_briar-rose,resultType:masonry][i]The Legend of Briar Rose[/i][/url] (1885-1890) \u2013 a series of paintings that portray the story of Sleeping Beauty. \n\nThroughout his career, Waterhouse had a habit of often using the same models, and the models in Saint Cecilia appear in other works by the artist. In recent research, one of his favorite sitters Muriel Foster was identified as the model for two angels in Saint Cecilia. Foster began modeling for Waterhouse at the age of fifteen in 1893 and was featured in paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/a-mermaid-1900][i]A Mermaid[/i][/url] (1900) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-william-waterhouse/lamia-and-the-soldier-1905][i]Lamia and the Soldier[/i][/url] (1905)."

This brief period called \u2018C\u00e9zannism\u2019 represents a phase in which the final stages of Fauvism overlapped with early [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubism[/url]. Derain\u2019s painting [i]Bathers[/i] was exhibited at the 1907 [i]Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants[/i] (The Salon of Independent Artists). The painting still had the vivid and intense colors of Fauvism, but Derain modeled the angular forms after C\u00e9zanne. Even though C\u00e9zannism took shape in 1907, C\u00e9zanne was a topic of discussion among [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/les-fauves#!#resultType:masonry]Fauvist artists[/url] long before. Derain was well acquainted with C\u00e9zanne work: there were forty-two C\u00e9zanne paintings at the 1904 [i]Salon d\u2019Automne[/i] (Autumn Salon) exhibition, ten at 1905 exhibition and ten at the 1906 exhibition. His friend and fellow Fauvist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse#!#resultType:masonry]Henri Matisse[/url] purchased C\u00e9zanne\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/three-bathers][i]Three Bathers[/i][/url] (1879-1882) in 1899. Additionally, a 1910 photograph of Derain shows that the artist kept a reproduction of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/five-bathers-1887][i]Five Bathers[/i][/url] (1885-1887) in his studio.\n\nThus, although Derain\u2019s [i]Bathers[/i] were built upon the themes of his earlier paintings, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andre-derain/the-dance-1906][i]The Dance[/i][/url] (1906) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andre-derain/golden-age][i]The Golden Age[/i][/url] (1905), the subject was also a reference to C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Bather series. Unlike earlier works, that focused on flat colorful surfaces, in [i]Bathers[/i] the principal concern was with angular planes and sculptural forms. Derain mixed several influences in [i]Bathers[/i]: while the figures bear some similarity to C\u00e9zanne\u2019s fleshy nudes, the other dominant influence is African art and culture. In 1905, Derain and painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/maurice-de-vlaminck#!#resultType:masonry]Maurice Vlaminck[/url] began visiting the Mus\u00e9e du Trocad\u00e9ro, which had a collection of tribal art and African masks. Around the same time, Derain began collecting African art, a collection he built up between the years 1906 and 1910. The influence of African sculpture is seen in the angular faces of the bathers. More specifically, the central figure was possibly modeled after a mask that Derain purchased from Vlaminck. A different possibility is that he modeled the central head after the block-like forms of French Congo sculptures. The pose of the bather on the left side was similar to Derain\u2019s stone sculpture [i]Standing Figure[/i] (1907), which was also inspired by African sculpture.\n\n[i]Bathers[/i] shows Derain\u2019s innovative thinking: he completed the painting before the 1907 C\u00e9zanne retrospectives and before [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso#!#resultType:masonry]Pablo Picasso[/url]\u2019s famous [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/the-girls-of-avignon-1907][i]Les Demoiselles d'Avignon[/i][/url] (1907). Scholars have debated the connection between Derain\u2019s [i]Bathers[/i] and Picasso [i]Les Demoiselles d'Avignon[/i], some arguing that Picasso influenced Derain\u2019s transition from Fauvism to C\u00e9zannism. Others claimed the opposite, that in fact Picasso was indebted to Derain, who made some of the early strides toward Cubism. However, what is most likely is that Picasso and Derain worked independently during the same period with C\u00e9zanne as their chief inspiration. Moreover, in this period artists like Matisse, Derain, Picasso, Vlaminck and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque#!#resultType:masonry]Georges Braque[/url] were all experimenting and discovering African art. Therefore, the similar interests of Cubists and Fauvists can account for Derain and Picasso reaching similar breakthroughs around the same time."

        "description": "Around 1475, Gaspare di Zanobi del Lama, a Florentine wealthy money changer and courtier of the Medici family, commissioned Sandro Botticelli, still a young painter protected by the Medici family, to paint an altarpiece for his funeral chapel in the church of Santa Maria Novella.\n\nThe work of the currency exchange was not well seen by the morality of the time: the people who exercised it were treated as usurers, because they got wealthy at the expense of their customers. For this reason, the members of the Arte del Cambio, the guild of which Gaspare di Zanobi was a part, used to invest great wealth in the creation of funerary monuments, making generous donations to the churches that accepted to host remains of them and their families. He wanted the chapel to be dedicated to the Epiphany, of which the Botticelli table was to be the main work of art. Above the table, Botticelli also painted the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/santa-maria-novella][i]Adoration of the Child[/i][/url] (1976), now detached and moved above the central portal of the Church, on the counter-fa\u00e7ade.\n\nThe scene depicts the moment in which the three wise men, Magi, arrived at the birthplace of Jesus Christ. In the history of Florentine art, this scene was frequently painted. In Florence there never existed a real legitimate noble lineage, so every family that came to power commissioned to a painter an Adoration of the Magi and asked to portrait the members of the family as wise men bowed before Jesus, in order to show to the citizen that their government was blessed by God.\n\nBotticelli fitted into this tradition, but he wanted to produce new, original work. He painted the usual subject: the Magi arriving at the manger. But, if in previous paintings the scene was depicted with the Kings arrived at the stable stately manger fitting for the Son of God,  the young Botticelli chose to place the scene in a dilapidated Roman ruin. At the center of this structure, he placed a sturdy rock for Mary and Jesus, to sit high above their visitors. With this decision, Botticelli seemed to say: Christianity will be built on sturdier materials than Rome.\n\nThe painter then populated the space with important men from his city. On the right side of the artworks, dressed in light blue, is the man who paid for it: Gaspare di Zanobi del Lama, looking out at the viewer and confidently pointing at himself, as to say that he gifted this beautiful piece of art to humanity. To paint the three Magi, appearing at the center of this painting, kneeling to Mary and Jesus, Botticelli took as models the members of the Medici family. This is a tribute wanted by the purchaser of the work: his wealth would not have been possible had he not been a courtier protected by Medici. In particular, by Cosimo de Medici, whom Botticelli painted prominently at Mary\u2019s feet, in the act of bowing to kiss the Child's foot. The other Wise can be identified as Piero and Giovanni de Medici, Cosimo\u2019s two sons. They are kneeling, speaking one each other. Finally, on the left in the painting, there is the portrait of the young Lorenzo il Magnifico, standing, with his hands entwined around the sword, who watches the scene as saying: today is your day, but I am the future.\n\nBotticelli filled the rest of the space with other friends and influential figures from Florence, and among them, on the right, the confident young artist painted himself, looking directly at the viewer. His presence in this painting illustrates a radical shift in the perception of artists during this time period: Botticelli did not view himself as an ordinary craftsman hired for a simple job, he saw himself as a friend to the powerful families of Florence.\n\n[b]by Maddalena Mongera[/b]"

It created a sensation when it was first exhibited at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp of the same year, and it cemented his growing reputation. According to Alma-Tadema, his teacher Jan August Henrik Leys was accepting of the work, but critical of the marble, which he likened to the texture of cheese. Taking the criticism very seriously, Alma-Tadema spent years perfecting his technique of variegated marble and granite. He became so well known for his realistic marble that he was eventually humorously referred to as a \u201cmarbelous painter.\u201d"

According to his register, Sully began the painting on May 8, 1821, and completed it on May 15. The artist is shown interrupted at his work, and emphasizes his profession through the paintbrush pointing to his sharply lit head. This device is common in self-portraits of artists, and Sully is thought to have adapted it from a similar work by Benjamin West, with whom he studied in London. Although Sully's brushwork is unusually restrained, its painterly quickness blends with the engaging spontaneity of the pose to create a sense of immediacy."

In portraying Kakabeka Falls, the artist has chosen as his subject one of the natural wonders along the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company (HBC) voyageur route. His depiction of these falls as a fearsome force of nature is intended to inspire and overwhelm the viewer, while the foreground wedge of land offers a stable view at a safe distance.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of an artist using a camera lucida, from the Dictionnaire encyclop\u00e9dique et biographique de l'industrie et des arts industriels (1882)\r\n          Kane was but a passenger when travelling with the HBC brigades, and while the men portaged, he would sketch. In executing his earlier drawing of this particular view, Kakabeka Falls, 1846, Kane appears to have been aided by an optical instrument. The precise articulation of outline and details of the \u201ctower\u201d in the middle, and the heavier pencil tracing the foliage and rocks in the foreground, suggest Kane used a device called a camera lucida. \r\n          In translating his linear rendition into an oil painting, Kane created a spectacular vision of the sublime. Light glances off the massive sheets of falling water, reflects off the horizontal striations of the chert2  rock, and vies with the storm cloud for supremacy. The diminutive Aboriginal figures on the riverbank are a typical Romantic device used to provide scale and emphasize the immensity of this natural wonder\u2014and, by projection, Kane\u2019s own experience. \r\n          Kane makes no mention of the falls by name in his field journal, nor does he indicate his response to the view; he simply notes that he made sketches of two portages along this leg of his journey.3  It is as though Kane relies on his drawing to accurately record his experience and his painting to emotionally express it."

        "description": "Equality is Bouguereau's first major painting, produced when he was a young man of 23, after two years at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris. Subjected to heavy pressure from his family, the artist knew he had to succeed at any cost. As the critic L\u00e9on Pl\u00e9e would write later, he was then \"in a hurry to make his name\".\n\nFor his first submission to the Salon, Bouguereau presented this spectacular, large format painting of an angel of death covering the body of a young man with a shroud. The image would move anyone with its evocation of the inevitability of death. This sombre vision serves as a warning, as this note on a preparatory drawing demonstrates: \"Equality. When the angel of death covers you with its shroud, your life will have been meaningless if you have not done some good on earth\u201d But the equality in question is not exactly the same as that which Liberals all over Europe aspired to achieve in 1848. Bouguereau is keeping to a conservative and deeply religious idea, where equality, far from being a social or political objective, only exists in the afterlife. The painting is therefore reminding us of both Bouguereau's anxiety about the political changes of his time and his more personal doubts about his own future.\n\nWith its concise style and frieze-like structure, the painting is reminiscent of the purism of the English Neo-Classical artist John Flaxman (1755-1826). Its funereal, dramatic character also links it to the Romantics. We are reminded of the famous painting by Pierre-Paul Prud'hon (1758-1823), Justice and Divine Vengeance pursuing Crime (1808, Paris, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre), and more recently of work by Henry Lehmann (1814-1882), Jeremy dictating his Prophesies (1842, Angers, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts), featuring similarly implacable angel figures."

Alma-Tadema, being a meticulous perfectionist, wanted each petal to be as perfectly realistic as possible, and had shipments of rose petals sent to him from the Riviera over the winter of 1887-1888, so he would have fresh examples. This was a common practice by Alma-Tadema, who often ordered flowers from all over Europe and sometimes Africa, as examples for his paintings, rushing to complete the work before the flowers died. "

Having left Adelaide during the Great Depression, Trenerry lived and worked in Willunga in relative isolation and poverty until 1951. In the early 1920s he lived briefly in Sydney where he studied at the Julian Ashton Art School. During this period he painted alongside Elioth Gruner who instilled in Trenerry a love of painting outdoors and an interest in depicting the effects of light on the Australian landscape. Returning to South Australia from Sydney in the late 1920s Trenerry developed a friendship with Hans Heysen who encouraged the younger artist to travel and visit the Flinders Ranges. Trenerry engaged with the painting styles of Gruner and Heysen, yet responded to the landscape with his own instinctive and highly sensitive approach.\r\n\r\nIn 'The ploughed field' Trenerry used a restricted palette, tightly structured composition and dynamic painterly surface typical of his work. He defined the expanse of the field with short, layered, vertical brushstrokes (depicting the crops) over long horizontal lines. Bands of pink, orange and red suggest the rich, fertile earth of the region. The trees, sky and distant buildings are represented by dabs, dots, scrapes and square strokes of paint. Trenerry often mixed oil paint with powdered paint, a technique that created the opaque and chalky effect characteristic of his work"

        "description": "[i]Home Again[/i] (1884) was one of Frederick McCubbin\u2019s early paintings, created while he was a student at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/national-gallery-of-victoria-art-school-melbourne]National Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne[/url]. McCubbin painted a domestic scene, which emphasized the woman\u2019s role and responsibility for the family\u2019s livelihood. Elements of the interior display how the young woman maintained the household while believing she was abandoned or widowed. The painting captures the dramatic moment of the husband bursting through the door to her surprise and the delight of the household pet.\n\nAt the time, McCubbin was studying under [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/george-folingsby]George Folingsby[/url], who was appointed painting master at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1882. Folingsby, an Irishman, was already an established portrait and history painter when he left Europe to immigrate to Australia. His genre paintings usually referenced historical or literary themes, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/george-folingsby/first-meeting-between-henry-viii-and-anne-boleyn-1879][i]The First meeting between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn[/i][/url] (1879). He was also responsible for the reorganization of the teaching methods at the school, by stopping the students from copying paintings in the gallery and encouraging them to sketch and paint from life. Folingsby was an essential influence on McCubbin during his formative years. [i]Home Again[/i] demonstrates how McCubbin applied Folingsby\u2019s theories to create a local contemporary setting. The popular press often published illustrated scenes of the bush and everyday life. Since McCubbin worked as an illustrator, it is possible that [i]Home again[/i] was inspired by a story in a popular magazine, a play, or a novel. This type of interior and composition of a figure entering a room was often repeated by final-year students at the Gallery School because these were similar to Folingsby\u2019s work.\n\nThe setting of [i]Home Again[/i] might have been the kitchen at the McCubbin family household at King Street. The same interior is seen in its entirety in another painting by McCubbin, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederick-mccubbin/kitchen-at-the-old-king-street-bakery-1884][i]Kitchen at the old King Street bakery[/i][/url] (1884). Although it is not certain, scholars have speculated that McCubbin created other paintings from the period in the vicinity of the family home and bakery: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederick-mccubbin/girl-with-bird-at-the-king-street-bakery-1886][i]Girl with a bird at the King Street bakery[/i][/url] (1886) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederick-mccubbin/old-stables-1884][i]Old Stables[/i][/url] (ca. 1884). [i]Home Again[/i] was first exhibited at the 2nd Annual Student Exhibition of the Gallery in 1884. The painting received favorable reviews from the press, and it won second prize at the exhibition (a reward of 20\u20a4). Despite it being an early work, certain elements are indicative of McCubbin\u2019s future style. In terms of subject matter, it can be seen as a forerunner of McCubbin\u2019s significant works that depicted daily activities of pioneer couples like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederick-mccubbin/on-the-wallaby-track-1896][i]On the Wallaby Track[/i][/url] (1896) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederick-mccubbin/the-pioneer-1904][i]The pioneer[/i][/url] (1904). Besides, the glimpse of the sunlit garden through the open door shows a little of McCubbin\u2019s future landscape paintings.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the painting was discovered in possession of the Bickley family. The McCubbins and Bickleys were both involved in the baking trade and had traveled on the same ship that came from England to Melbourne. Shortly after it resurfaced, [i]Home Again[/i] was acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria, and today it is available to the public as part of the gallery display."

Those sent to hell for the sin of greed are boiled in pots of gold, and in the sin of pride a demon holds a mirror up to a prideful woman. The series of paintings is much more than a description of each sin and its punishment, as a whole it represents a warning to those who would engage in sin, and acts as a deterrent to evil doing. "

Like his comic characters, the figures in the painting are strangely elongated with small heads on large bodies or squat and rotund, with very little detail on their faces.\r\n\r\nFeininger\u2019s multi-vantage point composition and Fauvist color scheme encourages a sensation of ambiguity. Buildings seem tilted and irregular, almost as if they are on the verge of toppling. The scale is reordered\u2014some of the human figures appear more substantial than the buildings\u2014and the color, of the sky in particular, is brash and unnatural.

In March of 1885, van Gogh\u2019s father, the Reverend Theodorus van Gogh, collapsed on the threshold of the family home, where the artist still lived. The experience was profoundly influential on this transitional period in van Gogh\u2019s oeuvre. By May, following his father\u2019s death, the artist left the parsonage and rented a small studio and sleeping quarters on his own in town.\r\n \u201cI have lately been making some studies of the fall landscape outdoors,\u201d wrote van Gogh in October of 1885 (quoted in Jan Hulsker, op. cit., p. 208). The works created in October and November of this year, the present painting included, are all the more poignant and emotive when considered in context of the changes the artist experienced during this year, and the looser application of paint that defines the foliage prefigures the more fiercely dramatic brushwork so characteristic of his later pictures."

Exhibited in 1819 at the Royal Academy, the painting was critically acclaimed, earning Constable the title of an Associate the same year. To create such sizable paintings, Constable first made sketches of the scene from life, which he then developed into a full-size oil sketch before creating the final piece.\n\nIn this painting, Constable presents a typical rural scene without glorifying or sympathizing with the workers' labor. He portrays them as he saw them, going about their daily lives. The image exudes an underlying persistence, evident in the barge men's figures as they strain against their poles. Despite the increasing threat of industrialization, Constable shows the workers continuing their traditional way of life with unwavering determination. This resilience is also reflected in the image of the tree on the right, which clings tenaciously to the waterlogged bank.\n\nAs is common in Constable's work, the vegetation is presented in scientific detail, with each species distinctly recognizable by its unique shape, color, and growth pattern. The painting features a vast array of greens, with particular emphasis on the delineation of different plant species, giving the image a lushness that captures the essence of the season and time of day."

        "description": "The group portrait depicts the family of Aubrey Charles Fitz-Roy Stuart Beauclerk (1740-1802), an English aristocrat and Duke of Saint Albans, during a visit to Italy. In the second half of the 18th century, portraits of tourists against the backdrop of Italian antiquities, archaeological monuments or Roman buildings became very popular. English intellectuals and aristocrats make up a large proportion of these portraits, since in the 18th century the English considered a trip to Italy, known as the Grand Tour, to be an essential part of a general education. As well as visiting famous monuments from antiquity and beyond, visiting families also collected works of art and were particularly interested in archaeological excavations. In 1779, Aubrey Beclerc, together with his compatriot Thomas Brand, financed an archaeological excavation organised by the painter, antiquarian and dealer in ancient art, Thom Jenkins (1722-1798), near Rome, in the area of the Centocelle (now a quarter of Rome). This excavation unearthed a number of ancient sculptures and other finds that later joined the collections of major museums (for an account of the excavation and the associated paintings by Smuglevi\u010dius, see Yarker Jonathan, Hornsby Clara, A Speculative Grand Tour Excavation: Aubrey Beauclerk, Thomas Brand and Thomas Jenkins at Centocelle, in: British Art Journal, 22 March 2011). It is likely that the Beauclerk family met Smuglevi\u010dius either through Jenkins or through James Byres of Tonley (1734-1817), a Scottish architect, antiquarian, art dealer and the main English guide to Rome, who had lived in Italy since 1756. Smuglevi\u010dius, who arrived in Rome in 1763, had a long-standing relationship with him, which may have begun at the Academy of St Luke's (where Smuglevi\u010dius had been a student since 1765 and Byres had been a professor at the art school since 1768). This canvas depicts the Bairs family in a room, the walls of which are decorated with a portrait of the husband and an antique relief. Another portrait of the same family, with the dome of St Patras Basilica in the background, dates from around 1770-1776 and is in a private collection (Brinsley Ford Collection) in London. Smuglevi\u010dius may have made the portrait of the Beclerks between the spring of 1779, when the family took up residence in an apartment rented by Thomas Jenkins in one of the villas of Castel Gandolfo (formerly Villa dei Gesuiti, now Villa Torloni), and the spring of 1780, when they departed from Italy. The group of people are depicted in a sumptuous, elegant interior, with the landscape of Castel Gandolfo stretching into the distance through an opening window against a canvas background. Looking at the canvas, it is easy to identify Lady Katerina (seated on the left side of the painting) and the girls - the elder one is drawing at a table, the younger one is playing with her dog. Duke O. Beklerk should be depicted in the centre of the picture, holding out a small ornament, which appears to be a cameo, to his wife. Meanwhile, the person on the right, who is focused on the newspaper, seems less connected to his family. I believe this is a representation of Thomas Jenkins, in whose house, as mentioned above, the Becklers stayed and whose archaeological excavations they supported. \"O. The portrait of the Becker family in Castel Gandolfo strikes a perfect balance between the naturalness of the poses and the eloquence of the gestures, and the images of the children are particularly sensitively rendered, with the girl's frank, straightforward gaze as she lifts her head from the drawing becoming the centre of the whole composition. The individuals are portrayed in a portrait-like, individualised manner, and their surroundings are also concrete, but the painting is not domestic, but permeated with allegorical images (the drapery and the column on the right are both an element of a particular terrace and a traditional symbol of luxury, wealth and nobility, the dog is a frequent companion of aristocrats of the time, but is also an old image of fidelity and obedience, etc.). The fine, meticulous manner of the painting, the suggestive materiality of the objects and clothes (especially the silky, shimmering dress of Lady Katerina and her ornate hairstyle) reflect the representational meanings of the portrait, but the overall palette of muted colours, the abundance of greyish, pearly tones, create a gentle, intimate mood.

The Librarian is one such painting. In this painting, Arcimboldo\u2019s subject is obvious: a lover of books made up out of books. This is an example of the painter\u2019s ability to be less literal. Whereas in other paintings, he shaped singular pieces of fruit or meat into the eyes, nose, or curve of the chin, in this painting, the pile of books only resembles a person, and upon closer inspection, the features become less clear. This is an example of Arcimboldo\u2019s great talent of disguising his objects into the form of a person, or as in this case, disguising his person into the form of his objects.   "

        "description": "In [i]The Spring[/i],  Botticelli creates an intellectual painting, addressed to a narrow circle of public able to recognize complex literary, philosophical, and iconographic references. Such as those that were formulated in Florentine intellectual circles, created by the Medici family. There are many interpretations proposed to dissolve the message of this work, made up of symbols and allegories. The characters can be identified on the basis of the comparison with different literary sources: the poem [i]Stanze for the carousel[/i] by Angelo Poliziano, contemporary of Botticelli, or with the texts of Latin authors most read in the 15th century, such as Lucrezio, Ovidio, Orazio.\n\nThe painted scene takes place in the garden of the Hesperides, the garden of the gods where the golden apples grow, identified in the Renaissance with the earthy oranges and lemons (which is why in the courts of Italian nobles there was always a citrus grove). The flowery lawn is rich in many different types of wildflowers. The characters are divided into groups. On the right there is a narrative scene: Zephyrus, the biting wind that announces spring in March, tries to kidnap the nymph Flora, who, frightened, tries to escape the kidnapping. In the end, Flora, possessed by the god, would agree to marry him and, as a gift, would be transformed into Flora, the Spring, eternally young and fruitful divinity. \n\nIn the center of the painting is Venus, goddess of sacred love, leaning against a myrtle bush, the sacred plant that symbolizes her. Above her, Cupid flies high, blindfolded. His wings come out of the painting, he launches a fiery arrow towards the Three Graces, the three successive figures of the work, intent in a dance in a circle. The last character, on the left, is Mercury, the messenger god, which can be recognized by the winged shoes and the [i]petasus[/i], the typically pointed hat of travelers. The god, with his rod, the [i]caduceus[/i], keeps away the clouds that threaten this ideal and eternal garden, where everything is a harmony of forms and feelings, a perfect microcosm, mirror of a universal macrocosm.\n\nFramed by the plants of the garden, the characters are painted by Botticelli with graceful poses and seem to barely touch the lawn of flowers, as if they were very light. Botticelli has no interest in weighing the muscles of the figures: he paints them sinuously, using curves and not right angles, to give the idea of characters out of time. For this reason, the painter also chooses bright colors, sometimes transparent, as in the dress of the nymph or graces. Botticelli inserted more than five hundred plant species into the painting, of which only two hundred were coming from Tuscany, making this art a herbarium in painting.\n\nHowever, the possibility of identifying the characters does not exhaust the meaning of the work of art. Venus, in a central position, is here painted not as the goddess of love but, as the Humanists considered her, goddess of [i]humanitas[/i], intellectual activities that elevated men from the world of the senses, personified by Zephyr, to the world of reason, Mercury. For this reason, Zephyr and Mercury are placed at two opposite poles of the painting. The makers of this process are the three Graces, seen in the Renaissance as an allegory of intellectual faculties.\n\nTwo of the Graces wear jewelry from the Medici family at their necks, making explicit a political meaning of the painting, that can be read as an allegory of the task of the Medici family in Florence. The only lineage that, being patron and protector of artists, can ignite this process of elevation and the flowering of Florence, which could be the place of the intellectual Spring of the new world, reborn in the Renaissance. This thesis is supported by a documentary source that says that the painting was commissioned to Botticelli in 1478, for the birth of Giulio, son of Giuliano de Medici, brother of Lorenzo the Magnificent.\n\n[b]by Maddalena Mongera[/b]"

The work, which stands about 9 metres high and more than 12 metres across, has little direct reference to the play and was apparently hurriedly completed as an enlargement from a small gouache - an opaque watercolour - which had been finished long before the commission. \n\nThe subject is a strange choice, because there is no iconographic or narrative link to Romain Rolland's enthusiastic play. There is evidence, though, that the artist did try a Revolutionary design but did not have the time to complete it. There is a curious drawing dated June 13, 1936 which shows a joyful crowd with what looks like a symbolic reference to the taking of the Bastille. On the other hand, Picasso was obsessed by personal allusions at the time with reference to mythology and bullfighting. You can see in the curtain the confrontation of good and evil, the victory of youth, and beauty conquering menace, which was a logical rapprochement of the epic themes of both Picasso and Rolland.\n\nPicasso was so attached to the work that he kept it in his Paris atelier throughout the war, and only donated it to Toulouse, a southern city with a strong bullfighting tradition, in 1965. At present the curtain is in its own gallery in the Espace d'Art Moderne et Contemporain, Toulouse, France."

Modern critics have many interpretations about the paintings style and placement of the figures.

        "description": "In his later years, Goya lived as a solitary and deaf recluse, disillusioned with society. He resided in his house, known as La Quinta del Sordo, located outside Madrid, where he completed his fourteen Black Paintings. Goya applied these paintings directly onto the plaster walls of his house, and despite their intensely personal nature, he did not provide any titles or write about them in his letters. These works are widely considered by art historians to reflect his deteriorating physical and mental health, as they express his deepest fears and darkest depression in a nightmarish and troubling form.\n\nOne of these paintings, known as Witches' Sabbath or The Great He-Goat, depicts a dark silhouette of the devil in the form of a goat, preaching to a group of women who are likely witches. Goya's use of rough and clumsy brushwork enhances the picture's raw and abject quality, with a cluster of ghastly characters huddled together. The use of theatrical contrasts of light and dark serves to highlight the repulsive faces of the women. Unfortunately, a large portion of the painting was lost in the transfer from plaster to canvas, leaving its full meaning and content shrouded in mystery.\n\nWitches' Sabbath is widely believed to be a critique of the Inquisition's oppressive practices and persecution, which intensified after the Bourbon monarchy's restoration in 1814 and the accession of Ferdinand VII, an anti-Enlightenment king. Goya was a staunch supporter of Enlightenment principles, which prioritized reason over religious and cult superstitions, and he abhorred the Inquisition's politically motivated actions."

Otani Oniji's leering face, shown in three-quarter view, bristling hair, and groping outstretched hands capture the ruthless nature of this wicked henchman. Sharaku was renowned for creating visually bold prints that gave rare revealing glimpses into the world of kabuki. He was not only able to capture the essential qualities of kabuki characters, but his prints also reveal, often with unflattering realism, the personalities of the actors who were famous for performing them. Because kabuki plays have relatively simple plots, the acting style of the performer is central to the performance. As a result, successful kabuki actors enjoyed great celebrity status. Unlike earlier masters, Sharaku did not idealize his subjects or attempt to portray them realistically. Rather, he exaggerated facial features and strove for psychological realism."

She supported Nolan while he painted the Kelly series. This painting is currently in the National Gallery of Australia. The painting was donated by Sunday Reed. Nolan had left the painting among many others at Heide. Although Nolan once wrote to Sunday Reed to tell her to take what she wanted, he subsequently demanded all his works back. Sunday Reed returned 284 other paintings and drawings to Nolan, but she refused to give up the 27 remaining Kellys, partly because she saw the works as fundamental to the proposed Heide Museum of Modern Art. Eventually, she gave them to the National Gallery of Australia in 1977 and this resolved the dispute.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, Nolan reproduced The Trial on a woven wool tapestry, which was lent to Admiralty House in Kirribilli, the official Sydney residence of the Governor-General of Australia.

        "description": "Flat Head Woman and Child, Caw-wacham was one of Kane\u2019s best-known paintings in his day and has proven to be one of his most controversial works. It depicts a woman with an infant whose head is being reshaped; the woman\u2019s own profile highlights the result of the traditional procedure. The image, inspired by Kane\u2019s encounter with the Aboriginal peoples of the Columbia River Valley, is a composite based on separate watercolours of members of two or three different tribes: one Cowlitz (the infant) and the other Songhees or Southern Coast Salish (the woman).1  Kane makes no mention of the reshaping process in his field journal, but it is featured in his book Wanderings of an Artist among the Indians of North America, including the explanation that the \u201cflat\u201d head is a \u201cdistinguishing mark of freedom.\u201d2\r\n\r\nWilliam Clark, Heads of Clatsop Indians, from Original Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, 1804\u20131806 (1905). Clark's drawing shows a child in process of having its head flattened, an old man, a young man, and a woman with shaped heads\r\n          For all the attention and controversy the painting has engendered, it is ironic that Kane depicts the flattening board in the \u201cup\u201d position rather than actually pressuring the child\u2019s skull, as was depicted in more documentary renderings of the procedure, such as a sketch from 1806 by William Clark (1770\u20131838) of a child in the process of having its head flattened.\r\n          Nineteenth-century responses to Flat Head Woman and Child addressed both aesthetic and ethnographic aspects. When Kane exhibited the painting (titled simply \u201cSketch of a Chinook\u201d) in the portrait category at the 1852 Upper Canada Provincial Exhibition, it was appreciated as much for the colour of its background landscape as it was as a \u201ctrait of Indian customs.\u201d3  Yet interest in its ethnographic references prevailed. The painting no doubt was on display at the Canadian Institute\u2019s March 1855 meeting featuring a reading of Kane\u2019s paper \u201cThe Chinook Indians,\u201d which included a description of the reshaping procedure. The reading was complemented by a display of Chinook cultural objects, a skull, and \u201cseveral admirable oil paintings, executed by Mr. Kane.\u201d4  Flat Head Woman and Child was also the inspiration for an image created by Kane\u2019s friend Daniel Wilson (1816\u20131892), who reviewed his book Wanderings of an Artist.5  Wilson made his own composite image for the frontispiece to his book Prehistoric Man6  using the same watercolour sketch of a Cowlitz infant and another by Kane of a Clallam woman weaving a basket.7\r\n          Modern commentary is more critical in tone. The art historian Heather Dawkins has approached Flat Head Woman and Child, from a post-colonial perspective, taking Kane to task for his Victorian imperialist viewpoint evident in his disregard for tribal distinctions.8  And, given that Kane painted this \u201cmother and child\u201d theme at a time when Western culture was showing an increased respect toward children, she questions Kane\u2019s motives in depicting this particular Aboriginal custom. Was he simply romanticizing Aboriginal life, or was he intentionally criticizing Aboriginal culture?"

Furthermore, the painting dates from Grigoriev's seminal period in New York, during which he exhibited widely with great success, was lauded by the critic Christian Brinton and enthusiastically promoted by James Rosenberg, the founder of the influential New Gallery in New York. Grigoriev's arresting figures made a profound impression upon the American public who were enthralled by the hidden narratives of his insightful portraits.\r\n\r\nIn 1922 Florence Cane (1882-1952) commissioned Grigoriev to paint a portrait of her twin daughters, Katherine (b. 1910) and Mary (1910-2003). Herself a painter, Florence and her husband, Melville Cane (1879-1980) - a copyright lawyer and published poet - were part of a thriving artistic community that included the artists Marsden Hartley, Alfred Stieglitz, John Marin, Joseph Stella, and Arthur Dove, as well as poets and novelists including e. e. cummings and Thomas Wolfe. At this time, Grigoriev was experiencing international success for his Rasse\u00efa cycle (circa 1916-1921) which combined his gift for portraiture with a steely critical eye and looked to the Russian countryside and peasant village life for subject-matter."

She began her image of Liebknecht as a lithograph but later completed it as her first woodcut print.\n\nThe woodcut print is a tribute to Liebknecht's ideas and actions and depicts him lying in state at his memorial, with mourners paying their respects. The composition plays with rigid horizontality and tilting arcs, with Liebknecht's body as a stiff, stone horizontal slab at the bottom center of the image. The mourners, mostly male workers of varying ages, occupy most of the composition and are arranged in a curved arc, with their heads and torsos bowed towards Liebknecht. The woman and child in the foreground symbolize future generations who benefit from Liebknecht's ideology, while the man's overemphasized hand prominently resting on Liebknecht's chest illustrates the physicality of the ideological fight.\n\nAlthough the woodcut print was meant to honor Liebknecht, some members of the German Communist Party objected to Kollwitz's work because she was not an official member of the party, despite her commitment to radical politics."

        "description": "[i]Rising road[/i] (1881)  depicts a fashionable bourgeois couple strolling on a country road on a summer day. Although the title does not mention a location, the brightly colored villa suggests that it was painted in the seaside resort of Trouville on the Normandy coast. The town was a fashionable destination for wealthy urban dwellers, and between 1880 and 1884, Caillebotte spent parts of his summers in Trouville participating in local regattas. The picturesque resort also appealed to many artists: painters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Gustave Courbet[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet]Claude Monet[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-boudin]Eug\u00e8ne Boudin[/url] all spent time working in Trouville. The hot season in Trouville was also very fruitful for Caillebotte, who throughout four summers painted around fifty canvases of the town and the region.\n\n[i]Rising road[/i] was first exhibited to the public at the 7th Impressionist exhibition in 1882. Unlike earlier shows, the 1882 exhibition received relatively positive reviews from critics, who praised their emphasis on landscape painting and the practice of painting [i]en plein air[/i] (painting outdoors). Caillebotte presented a total of seventeen paintings: nine landscapes, two still-lifes, and six genre paintings. [i]Rising road[/i] received a considerable amount of attention, and a caricature of the painting was featured in the Parisian journal [i]Le Charivari[/i]. After this, the painting found its way into a private collection, where it remained out of the public eye for over a century. The only available record of the painting\u2019s appearance was the caricature in [i]Le Charivari[/i] and subsequently very little was known or written about the painting. [i]Rising road[/i] reemerged in 1994 at the international retrospective [i]Gustave Caillebotte: Urban Impressionist[/i] held at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, and The Art Institute of Chicago. Its rediscovery contributed significantly to the study of Caillebotte\u2019s oeuvre and the history of the Impressionist movement.\n\nIn [i]Rising road[/i], Caillebotte creates a synthesis of the two main characteristics of his art \u2013 his urban figure paintings from the 1870s and the landscape paintings and garden scenes created during the 1880s. He experiments with the perspective by creating a sharp diagonal with the garden wall, giving the impression of a steep path. This echoes his earlier experimentation with perspective seen in his Parisian views like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/the-boulevard-viewed-from-above-1880][i]The boulevard Viewed From Above[/i][/url] (1880) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/view-from-a-balcony-1880][i]View from a balcony[/i][/url] (c. 1880). In terms of the composition, the artist used the path to divide the space into two halves: the architecture of the villa on the left and the wild vegetation of the right. In this way, Caillebotte continues to explore themes of rapid development and transformation that dominated his work in the 1870s in urban scenes like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/le-pont-de-l-europe-1877][i]Le Pont de l\u2019Europe[/i][/url] (The Europe Bridge) (1876) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/paris-a-rainy-day-1877][i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i][/url] (1877). Thus, the fashionable couple at the center of the path symbolizes Trouville\u2019s transformation from a rural fishing village to a bourgeois resort. At the same time, the free and animated brushwork of the painting signifies Caillebotte\u2019s departure from his work in the 1870s. The loose brushwork, comparable to that of fellow Impressionists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/camille-pissarro]Camille Pissarro[/url] and Monet, was characteristic of his work in the 1880s, especially landscapes like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/the-pink-villa-at-trouville][i]The Pink villa at Trouville[/i][/url] (1884) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/the-plain-of-gennevilliers-from-the-hills-of-argenteuil-1888][i]The Plain of Gennevilliers from the Hills of Argenteuil[/i][/url] (1888)."

As a method of self-promotion and advertisement, Courbet made an impression with his self-portraits, and used them to find his own artistic style. After this period, Courbet became convinced that painters should illustrate the world around them as they see it and his realistic work in the later 1840\u2019s gained support among younger realist and neo-romantic painters.

This may seem like an everyday gesture, but during the Renaissance a carnation symbolized either the Crucifixion or the Virgin's pure love. Thus the painting suggests that Christ, even as an infant, embraced his future sacrifice on the cross, while his mother's pensive expression implies her comprehension of what his action signifies.\n\nThough not as well known today, Luini was once considered the leading painter from the Lombardy region of northern Italy. He was born about 1480 and trained with several local masters, but his life and art were transformed by encountering the work of Leonardo da Vinci, who visited Milan once in the late 15th century and again briefly in the early 16th century. Leonardo, as a young artist in Florence, painted several pictures with the same theme as that seen in this painting: the Christ child reaching for a flower. And it seems clear that Luini is indebted to Leonardo not only for this poignant theme but for other aspects of the painting as well: the dark background, the softness of the forms, the chiaroscuro (light and dark) modeling, the sweet sentiment of the figures, the turning pose of the Child.\n\nLuini was a great painter of religious images, including frescoes, wood panels, large altarpieces, and small devotional works for the home. He was obviously very popular in his own time, as there are countless copies of his paintings. Then he regained popularity in the 19th century when the famous critic John Ruskin decided that Luini was greater than Leonardo, and many readers went to Italy looking for his works."

It discusses a variety of topics actualized by the war escalation. The paintings address the embellished reality that frames horrible war crimes and suffering caused by the atrocity of the war.

Cassatt was able to avid an over-sentimental portrayal of this intimate scene by using the aforementioned techniques, diving us a glimpse into the bath without dripping with sweet sentimentality. Cassatt was also influenced to use this Japanese wood block technique by the works of Edgar Degas, who created many similar works. "

The figure, which could be Palmina, one of Pellizza's favourite models who had already been portrayed in Cherries, appears extraordinary and \"modern\" for the use of \"tone on tone\" colour, in a refined symphony of greens, raised by the reds and pinks of the complexion and blouse, and contrasted with grey and white. The facial expression is very intense, but veiled with sadness and unease, a sentimental element that led the critics to name the work Maternity incipient. The original title might have been Ritratto di giovane donna (Portrait of a Young Woman), if one wanted to identify the painting with the canvas exhibited by Pellizza in Turin in 1892, next to the Portrait of the Mediator Giani. The work had aroused the interest of his Macchiaioli friend Plinio Nomellini, whom he had met in Florence, but disconcerted the critics who considered the painted figure to be \"unattractive and so... pathological looking\" but \"despite a certain monotony of colour, it is one of the best paintings in the exhibition\". The particular chromatic sensitivity shown in this canvas is the first step towards the complete lightening of the chromatic range and the gradual elimination of the earth tones that would characterise his later works, where through pure colours, tone on tone, Pellizza would try to obtain the maximum in naturalistic luminosity and vivacity."

        "description": "[i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] (2003) by Edward Ruscha belongs to a large group of paintings, which depict a natural landscape overlayed with text. Ruscha used the scheme for nearly five decades: from early examples in the 1980s such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/not-a-bad-world-is-it-1984][i]Not A Bad World, Is It?[/i][/url] (1984) up to recent paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/wall-rocket-2013][i]Wall Rocket[/i][/url] (2013) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/tulsa-slut-2016][i]Tulsa Slut[/i][/url] (2016). \n\n[i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] depicts snow-covered mountaintops against a yellow sky, that signifies a sunset or a sunrise. For paintings like [i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] the artist usually appropriated landscapes from postcard images of different mountain ranges. The process of creating the painting began with a thin layer of paint sprayed onto the canvas. Later, the artist worked on the landscape in acrylic paint, and finally applied the lettering by using stencils. The font, named [i]Boy Scout Utility Modern[/i], was designed by Ruscha in the 1980s. The artist described it as a \u2018no style\u2019 typeface, and he has used it in many of his subsequent works.\n\nWhen describing the concept behind painting, Ruscha stated: [i]\u2018It\u2019s not a celebration of nature. I\u2019m not trying to show beauty. It\u2019s more like I\u2019m painting ideas of ideas of mountains. The concept came to me as a logical extension of the landscapes that I\u2019ve been painting for a while \u2013 horizontal landscapes, flatlands, the landscape I grew up in. Mountains like this were only ever a dream to me; they meant Canada or Colorado\u2019[/i]. In other words, Ruscha purposefully chose to paint the landscape in an impersonal and detached manner from distant images found on souvenirs. Combined with the text \u2018Pay Nothing Until April\u2019, the painting is reminiscent of a poster in the window or an advertising for a bargain ski holiday. In particular, the text is similar to the advertising slogan formula \u2018Buy Now, Pay Nothing until April\u2019. Advertising and consumer culture are consistent themes in Ruscha\u2019s art. [i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] continues this exploration by mimicking the aesthetic of mass produced culture.\n\nAnother important element in Ruscha\u2019s art is his living and working environment, the city of Los Angeles. In particular, Los Angeles as the center of the entertainment industry has played a significant role in Ruscha\u2019s work in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/large-trademark-with-eight-spotlights-1962][i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i][/url] (1962) and his photo book, [i]Every Building on the Sunset Strip[/i] (1966).  The mountain peaks of [i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] can be linked to visual images from adventure movies such as the James Bond film [i]On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service[/i] (1969). Another possible inspiration was the logo of Paramount Pictures, one of Hollywood\u2019s largest production companies. Through these associations to consumerist imagery and culture, the artist removed the mystique and sublime qualities of the natural landscape. Unlike the sublime landscapes of the 19th century European [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism#!#resultType:masonry]Romantic[/url] painters, that celebrated the power and greatness of nature, Ruscha\u2019s painting embraces the banality of consumerist culture by covering the landscape with an advertising slogan. This is also a reflection of Los Angeles, a place Ruscha called \u2018the ultimate cardboard town\u2019."

Pissarro's depiction of peasant life along with his own scientific explorations of color speaks to the anarchist theories he adopted in the latter half of the 1870s.\n\nPissarro felt that his scientific studies freed him from the Academy's strictures of how to see and depict reality. He also evoked the utopian visions of peasant societies he read about in the writings of anarchists Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Peter Kropotkin. Pissarro wanted \"to educate the public,\" by portraying the common man, but he also wanted to avoid idealizing and sentimentalizing his subjects. In this work, he depicts the effort of hay harvesting, both in the man at the left arching his back to toss the hay up and in the woman at the center, the strength palpable in her back and shoulders."

        "description": "While Moses' way of piecing together compositions was partly dictated by her sense of abstract design, the arrangements were always subordinated to the requirements of the landscape. As a substitute for academic perspective (which she had never learned), she had recourse not just to a progressive scheme of diminishing sizes, but also to coloristic indicators of space. She was quick to note such qualities as the pale blue of distant hills, or the tonal gradations of the sky. She translated phenomena observed from nature into veils of color and layers of pigment.\r\n\r\nThe Spring in Evening is notable for the way in which Moses captured both time of year and time of day. The rawness of the freshly plowed earth, the new growth on the hillside, and the lambent pink of the sunset are all rendered with a sure feel for color and a striking verisimilitude. Variations in the physical and tonal density of the paint create a series of transitions between the artist s anecdotal vignettes and the more complex hues of the landscape. The bold silhouette of the horses and the houses are spare, formal essences embedded in a network of paint. It is, however, the natural landscape that brings the whole to life."

During the time it was painted, Degas was known for historical paintings or those with a literary influence, but no such influence or historical story can be related Interior. The most wide agreement is that the painting refers to a scene in the novel Therese Raquin, by Emile Zola, published in 1867. It is referred to as one of the most dramatic and theatrical of all of Degas\u2019 compositions, as the items in the room are placed almost as props and the depiction of the characters had a stage-like, theatrical quality.

A narcissus, indicating vanity, leans towards the artist. The woman\u2019s face is scarred with a freggio, inflicted on Neapolitan women by their lovers to make them unattractive to others.

Firstly, it exemplifies his ability to create religious paintings, even though it was not his primary focus. John's wild gesturing signifies the arrival of Christ, represented by the lamb beside him and the cross he holds, symbolizing his sacrificial death. Secondly, it highlights Reynolds' inspiration from Italian Old Masters, evident in the intricate shading techniques reminiscent of Caravaggio and reference to Raphael's work. Finally, depicting John as a child provided Reynolds with the opportunity to create a fancy picture, a genre he enjoyed and was known for. According to curator Lucy Davis, \"the subject allowed him to pay tribute to Old Master religious art in composition and technique while also aligning closely with his secular fancy pictures of children.\""

The popular subject was portrayed by Jan Steen in eighteen paintings, in which typically a young woman suffers from an ailment related to love. Lovesickness, called in Dutch [i]minne-pijn[/i] or [i]minne koortz[/i] meaning \u2018pain or fever of the heart\u2019, was a condition discussed in medical essays in the 17th century. The strange condition had only one socially acceptable cure, marriage. In paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/doctor-s-visit-1662][i]Doctor\u2019s Visit[/i][/url] (ca. 1661-1662), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/the-lovesick-maiden-1660][i]The Lovesick Maiden[/i][/url] (ca. 1660), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/doctor-s-visit-1][i]Doctor\u2019s Visit[/i][/url] (ca. 1660),  and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/the-doctor-s-visit-1663][i]Doctor\u2019s Visit[/i][/url] (ca. 1663), Steen showed variation and developed each face in a different way.\n\nOne of the most intriguing examples of Steen\u2019s treatment of the subject is Doctor\u2019s Visit (1663-1665). In the painting, Steen injects humor and wit to relay poignant commentary on the subject. The scene shows the doctor examining the young maiden by checking her pulse, while the housemaid opens the door letting in a young man, probably the maiden\u2019s lover. The onlookers in the room all seem to be aware of the patient\u2019s condition, except for the doctor. The artist emphasizes the doctor\u2019s state of oblivion, he seems baffled by the maiden\u2019s quickened pulse, completely unaware that she spotted her lover in the doorway behind him. Steen even dressed the doctor\u2019s in an old fashioned garment, that is somewhat similar to a theater costume. On the floor next to the maiden\u2019s foot is a love letter, as well as a vessel with a smoldering ribbon, which was a technique used by quacks for determining a pregnancy. According to one version of the test, the ribbon would be dipped in the patient\u2019s urine and burned, and if the patient would become nauseous by the smell it meant that she was pregnant. The woman in the center of the composition is playing the harpsichord. Music, was considered a cure for melancholy, as well as a symbol of love, and here it can represent the harmony between the two lovers. All these details are carefully placed to hint at the situation and ignite the imagination of the viewer.\n\nMost significantly, Steen inserts himself into the scene, in the right corner of the composition. He holds up a herring and two onions - these are suggestive hinting at a phallic symbol. This symbolism adds a dimension of folly and absurdity to the painting. Steen wears a slashed beret associated with the fool of the Dutch rhetoricians, but at the same time he transforms this known model. Even though he is part of the composition, Steen directly confronts the viewer, emphasizing his role as a commentator. By placing himself on the outside, he reminds the viewer that the scene is staged. By infusing a theatrical influence of Dutch rhetoricians into the painting, Steen explores the metaphor of the world as a stage, a concept which was very popular in 17th century Dutch culture."

The ostrich women may tempt or pursue men, but these are pictures of states of mind rather than narration; the most 'abstract', in the imaginative sense, of her career so far.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there's much happiness in these pictures,\" says Lila Nunes, who being Portuguese nevertheless recognises their ferocity. \"Some of them would eat you up. They even go out looking. The sleeping one is the safest.\" Her opinion of a recent article on The Ostriches is indicative: \"Not bad, considering the writer wasn't Portuguese.\" Even the light on the pictures seems Portuguese, a storm light fit for Harpies, though they were drawn in Camden Town and done for 'Spellbound', an exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in spring 1996 to mark the centenary of British cinema."

It discusses a variety of topics actualized by the war escalation. The paintings address the embellished reality that frames horrible war crimes and suffering caused by the atrocity of the war.

She holds a bundle of a rose and some leaves, which she ties together with a ribbon, as if she just picked them from the beautiful gardens of Versailles, as suggested by the rosebush, small patch of sky, and large tree in the background. Although this portrait meets the requirements of a royal painting, the queen's knowing smile implies that there is something more to the story.\n\nThe painting of Marie-Antoinette that we see today is actually a replacement for a scandalous work that was originally displayed at the artist's first Salon entry in 1783. The original painting depicted the queen in a simple chemise dress, without the restrictive corset, and her natural hair, slightly tousled, pulled back under a straw hat, instead of the refined blue silk and lace gown and required royal accoutrements. Additionally, she held a pink rose, which was interpreted as a symbol of her Habsburg identity, rather than symbolizing the wealth and grandeur of the luxurious royal gardens. After facing public outcry, it was promptly removed and replaced with the portrait we see here.\n\nThe intricate and luxurious textures of the queen's attire, from the crisp satin and delicate lace of her dress to the feathery puffs of her wig, signify her wealth, elegance, and royal status. The features of the Habsburg family are softened, as in all of Vig\u00e9e Le Brun's portraits of the queen, producing an exceptionally flattering image. Her elongated neck, erect posture, and composed gaze all convey a sense of power. This is juxtaposed with the delicacy of her extended little finger, and the fact that she does not touch the rose directly at all. The brightness of her skin and sky-blue dress contrast with the darkness of the foliage and evening sky, giving her the appearance of being illuminated by a divine light."

The painting is a complex, formal composition in a studio setting. Using mirrors, Knight painted herself and Naper as seen by someone entering the studio behind them both. As an art student Knight had not been permitted to directly paint nude models but, like all female art students at the time, was restricted to working from casts and copying existing drawings. Knight deeply resented this and Self Portrait with Nude is a clear challenge, and reaction, to those rules. The painting was first shown, in 1913, at the Passmore Edwards Art Gallery in Newlyn and was well received by both the local press and other artists. Although the Royal Academy rejected exhibiting the painting, it was shown at the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers in London, as The Model. The Daily Telegraph critic called the painting \"vulger\" and suggested that it \"might quite appropriately have stayed in the artist's studio.\" Despite this reaction, Knight continued to exhibit the painting throughout her career and it continued to receive press criticism. After Knight died, the picture, now known simply as Self Portrait (1913), was purchased by the National Portrait Gallery and is now considered both a key work in the story of female self-portraiture and as symbolic of wider female emancipation."

It is the equation of the Universe, the initial and final balance of the opposites; Air, in this card, therefore quintessentially means a vacuum.\n\nIn the medieval pack, the title of the card is Le Mat, adapted from the Italian Matto, madman or fool; the propriety of this title will be considered later. But there is another, or (one might say) a complementary, theory. If one assumes that the Tarot is of Egyptian origin, one may suppose that Mat (this card being the key card of the whole pack) really stands for Maut, the vulture goddess, who is an earlier and more sublime modification of the idea of Nuith than Isis.\n\nThere are two legends connected with the vulture. It is sup posed to have a spiral neck; this may possibly have reference to the theory (recently revived by Einstein, but mentioned by Zoroaster in his Oracles) that the shape of the Universe, the form of that energy which is called the Universe, is spiral.\n\nThe other legend is that the vulture was supposed to reproduce her species by the intervention of the wind; in other words, the element of air is considered as the father of all manifested existence. There is a parallel in Anaximenes\u2019 school of Greek philosophy.\n\nThis card is therefore both the father and the mother, in the most abstract form of these ideas. This is not a confusion, but a deliberate identification of the male and the female, which is justified by biology. The fertilized ovum is sexually neutral. It is only some unknown determinant in the course of development which decides the issue.\n\nIt is necessary to acclimatise oneself to this at first sight strange, idea. As soon as one has made up one\u2019s mind to consider the feminine aspect of things, the masculine element should immediately appear in the same flash of thought to counterbalance it. This identification is complete in itself) philosophically speaking; it is only later that one must consider the question of the result of formulating Zero as \u201cplus I plus minus I\u201d. The result of so doing is to formulate the idea of Tetragrammaton. \n\n\nTHE FORMULA OF TETRAGRAMMATON \n\nIt is explained in this essay (see 16, 34, et al.) that the whole of the Tarot is based upon the Tree of Life, and that the Tree of Life is always cognate with Tetragrammaton. One may sum up the whole doctrine very briefly as follows:\n\nThe Union of the Father and the Mother produces Twins, the son going forward to the daughter, the daughter returning the energy to the father; by this cycle of change the stability and eternity of the Universe are assured.\n\nIt is necessary, in order to understand the Tarot, to go back in history to the Matriarchal (and exogamic) Age, to the time when succession was not through the first-born son of the King, but through his daughter. The king was therefore not king by inheritance, but by right of conquest. In the most stable dynasties, the new king was always a stranger, a foreigner; what is more, he had to kill the old king and marry that king\u2019s daughter. This system ensured the virility and capacity of every king. The stranger had to win his bride in open competition. In the oldest fairy-tales, this motive is continually repeated. The ambitious stranger is often a troubadour; nearly always he is disguised, often in a repulsive form. Beauty and the Beast is a typical tale. There is often a corresponding camouflage about the king\u2019s daughter, as in the case of Cinderella and the Enchanted Princess.\n\nThe tale of Aladdin gives the whole of this fable in a very elaborate form, packed with technical tales of magic. Here then is the foundation of the legend of the Wandering Prince---and, note well, he is always \u201cthe fool of the family\u201d. The connection between foolishness and holiness is traditional. It is no sneer that the family nitwit had better go into the church. In the East the madman is believed to be \u201cpossessed\u201d, a holy man or prophet. So deep is this identity that it is actually embedded in the language. \u201cSilly\u201d means empty-the Vacuum of Air-Zero-\u201cthe silly buckets on the deck\u201d. And the word is from the German selig, holy, blessed. It is the innocence of the Fool which most strongly characterizes him. It will be seen later how important is this feature of the story.\n\nTo ensure the succession, it was therefore devised: firstly, that the blood royal should really be the royal blood, and secondly, that this strain should be fortified by the introduction of the conquering stranger, instead of being attenuated by continual in-breeding.\n\nIn certain cases this theory was pushed very far; there was probably a great deal of chicanery about this disguised prince. It may well have been that the king, his father, furnished him with very secret letters of introduction; in short, that the old political game was old even in those primeval times.\n\nThe custom is therefore developed into the condition so admirably investigated by Frazer in the Golden Bough. (This Bough is no doubt a symbol of the King\u2019s Daughter herself). \u201cThe king\u2019s daughter is all glorious within; her raiment is of wrought gold.\u201d \n\nHow did such a development come to pass?\n\nThere may have been a reaction against playing politics; there may have been a glorification, first of all of the \u2018gentleman burglar\u2019, finally of the mere gangster-boss, rather as we have seen in our own times, in the reaction against Victorianism. The \u201cwandering prince\u201d was closely examined as to his credentials; unless he were an escaped criminal he was not eligible to compete; nor was it sufficient for him to win the king\u2019s daughter in open competition, live in the lap of luxury until the old king died, and succeed him in peace; he was obliged to murder the old king with his own hand.\n\nAt first sight it would appear that the formula is the union of the extremely masculine, the big blond beast, with the extremely feminine, the princess who could not sleep if there was a pea beneath her seven feather beds. But all such symbolism defeats itself; the soft becomes the hard, the rough the smooth. The deeper one goes into the formula, the closer becomes the identification of the Opposites. The Dove is the bird of Venus, but the dove is also a symbol of the Holy Ghost; that is, of the Phallus in its most sublimated form. There is therefore no reason for surprise in observing the identification of the father with the mother.\n\nNaturally, when ideas so sublime become vulgarized, they fail to exhibit the symbol with lucidity. The great hierophant, confronted with a thoroughly ambiguous symbol, is compelled, just because of his office as hierophant---that is, one who manifests the mystery---to \u201cdiminish the message to the dog\u201d. This he must do by exhibiting a symbol of the second order, a symbol suited to the intelligence of the second order of Initiates. This symbol, instead of being universal, and thus beyond ordinary expression, must be further adapted to the intellectual capacity of the particular set of people whom it is the business of the hierophant to initiate. Such truth accordingly appears to the vulgar as fable, parable, legend, even creed. \n\nIn the case of this comprehensive symbol of The Fool, there are, within actual knowledge, several quite distinct traditions, very clear; and, historically, very important.\n\nThese must be considered separately in order to understand the single doctrine from which all sprang.\n\n\nThe \u201cGreen Man\u201d of the Spring Festival. \u201cApril Fool.\u201d The Holy Ghost.\n\nThis tradition represents the original idea adapted to the under- standing of the average peasant. The Green Man is a personification of the mysterious influence that produces the phenomena of spring. It is hard to say why it should be so, but it is so: there is a connection with the ideas of irresponsibility, of wantonness, of idealization, of romance, of starry dreaming.\n\nThe Fool stirs within all of us at the return of Spring, and be cause we are a little bewildered, a little embarrassed, it has been thought a salutary custom to externalise the subconscious impulse by ceremonial means. It was a way of making confession easy. Of all these festivals it may be said that they are representations in the simplest form, without introspection, of a perfectly natural phenomenon. In particular are to be noted the custom of the Easter Egg and the \u201cPoisson d\u2019avril\u201d. (The Saviour Fish is discussed elsewhere in this essay. The precession of the Equinoxes has made Spring begin with the entry of the Sun into Aries the Ram, instead of Pisces the Fishes as was the case in the earliest times recorded.) \n\n\nThe \u201cGreat Fool\u201d of the Celts (Dalua) \n\nThis is a considerable advance on those purely naturalistic phenomena above described; in the Great Fool is a definite doctrine. The world is always looking for a saviour, and the doctrine in question is philosophically more than a doctrine; it is a plain fact. Salvation, whatever salvation may mean, is not to be obtained on any reasonable terms. Reason is an impasse, reason is damnation; only madness, divine madness, offers an issue. The law of the Lord Chancellor will not serve; the law-giver may be an epileptic camel-driver like Mohammed, a megalomaniac provincial upstart like Napoleon, or even an exile, three-parts learned, one-part crazy, an attic-dweller in Soho, like Karl Marx. There is only one thing in common among such persons; they are all mad, that is\u2019 inspired. Nearly all primitive people possess this tradition, at least in a diluted form. They respect the wandering lunatic, for it may be that he is the messenger of the Most High.\n\n\u201cThis queer stranger? Let us entreat him kindly. It may be that we entertain an angel unawares\u201d.\n\nClosely bound up with this idea is the question of paternity. A saviour is needed. What is the one thing certain about his qualifications? That he should not be an ordinary man. (In the Gospels people cavilled about the claim that Jesus was the Messiah because he came from Nazareth, a perfectly well-known town, because they knew his mother and his family; in brief, they argued that he did not qualify as a candidate for Saviour.) The saviour must be a peculiarly sacred person; that he should be a human being at all is hardly credible. At the very least, his mother must be a virgin; and, to match this wonder, his father cannot be an ordinary man; there fore, his father must be a god. But as a god is a gaseous vertebrate, he must be some materialization of a god. Very good!\n\nLet him be the god Mars under the form of a wolf, or Jupiter as a bull, or a shower of gold, or a swan; or Jehovah in the form of a dove; or some other creature of phantasy, preferably disguised in some animal form. There are innumerable forms of this tradition, but they all agree on one point: the saviour can only appear as the result of some extra ordinary accident, quite contrary to whatever is normal. The slightest suggestion of anything reasonable in this matter would destroy the whole argument. But as one must obtain some concrete picture, the general solution is to represent the saviour as the Fool. (Attempts to attain this condition appear in the Bible. Note the \u201ccoat of many colours\u201d of Joseph and of Jesus; it is the man in motley who brings his people out of bondage.)\n\n[Call him \u201cHarlequin\u201d, and a Tetragrammaton evidently burlesquing the Sacred Family springs to sight: Pantaloon, the aged \u201cantique-antic\u201d; Clown and Harlequin, two aspects of the Fool; and Columbine, the Virgin. But, being burlesque, the tradition is confused and the deep meaning lost; just as the medieval Mystery-Play of Pontius and Judas became the farce, with opportunist topical variants, \u201cPunch and Judy\u201d.]\n\nIt will be seen later how this idea is linked with that of the mystery of paternity, and also of the iridescence of the alchemical mercury in one of the stages of the Great Work. \n\n\n\u201cThe Rich Fisherman\u201d: Percivale \n\nThe legend of Percivale, integral of the mystery of the Saviour Fish-God, and of the Sangraal or Holy Grail, is of disputed origin. It appears certainly, first of all, in Brittany, the land best beloved of Magick, the land of Merlin, of the Druids, of the forest of Broceliande. Some scholars suppose that the Welsh form of this tradition, which lends much of its importance and its beauty to the Cycle of King Arthur, is even earlier. This is in this place irrelevant; but it is vital to realize that the legend, like that of The Fool, is purely pagan in origin, and comes to us through Latin-Christian recensions: there is no trace of any such matters in the Nordic mythologies. (Percivale and Galahad were \u201cinnocent\u201d: this is a condition of the Guardian ship of the Grail). Note also that Monsalvat, mountain of Salvation, home of the Graal, the fortress of the Knights Guardians, is in the Pyrenees. \n\nIt may be best to introduce the figure of Parsifal in this place, because he represents the western form of the tradition of the Fool, and because his legend has been highly elaborated by scholarly initiates. (The dramatic setting of Wagner\u2019s Parsifal was arranged by the then head of the O.T.O.)\n\nParsifal in his first phase is Der reine Thor, the Pure Fool. His first act is to shoot the sacred swan. It is the wantonness of innocence. In the second act, it is the same quality that enables him to withstand the blandishments of the ladies in the garden of Kundry. Klingsor, the evil magician, who thought to fulfil the conditions of life by self- mutilation, seeing his empire threatened, hurls the sacred lance (which he has stolen from the Mountain of Salvation) at Parsifal, but it remains suspended over the boy\u2019s head. Parsifal seizes it; in other words, attains to puberty. (This transformation will be seen in the other symbolic fables, below.)\n\nIn the third act, Parsifal\u2019s innocence has matured into sanctification; he is the initiated Priest whose function is to create; it is Good Friday, the day of darkness and death. Where shall he seek his salvation? Where is Monsalvat, the mountain of salvation, which he has sought so long in vain? He worships the lance: immediately the way, so long closed to him, is open; the scenery revolves rapidly, there is no need for him to move. He has arrived at the Temple of the Graal. All true ceremonial religion must be solar and phallic in character. It is the wound of Amfortas which has removed the virtue from the temple. (Amfortas is the symbol of the Dying God.)\n\nAccordingly, to redeem the whole situation, to destroy death, to reconsecrate the temple, he has only to plunge the lance into the Holy Grail; he redeems not only Kundry, but himself. (This is a doctrine only appreciable in its fulness by members of the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis of the ninth degree of O.T.O.)\n\nThe Crocodile (Mako, son of Set; or Sebek) \n\nThis same doctrine of maximum innocence developing into maximum fertility is found in Ancient Egypt in the symbolism of the Crocodile god Sebek. The tradition is that the crocodile was unprovided with the means of perpetuating his species (compare what is said above about the vulture Maut). Not in spite of, but because of this, he was the symbol of the maximum of creative energy. (Freud, as will be seen later, explains this apparent antithesis.)\n\nOnce again, the animal kingdom is invoked to fulfil the function of fathering the redeemer. On the banks of the Euphrates men worshipped Oannes, or Dagon, the fish god. The fish as a symbol of fatherhood, of motherhood, of the perpetuation of life generally, constantly recurs. The letter N. (Nun, N, in Hebrew means Fish) is one of the original hieroglyphs standing for this idea, apparently because of the mental reactions excited in the mind by the continual repetition of this letter. There are thus a number of gods, goddesses, and eponymous heroes, whose legends are functions of the letter N. (With regard to this letter, see Atu XIII.)\n\nIt is connected with the North, and so with the starry heavens about the Pole Star; also with the North wind; and the reference is to the Watery signs. Hence the letter N. occurs in legends of the Flood and of fish gods. In Hebrew mythology, the hero concerned is Noah. Note also that the symbol of the Fish has been chosen to represent the Redeemer or Phallus, the god through whose virtue man passes through the waters of death. The common name for this god, in southern Italy to-day, and elsewhere, is Il pesce. So, also, his female counterpart, Kteis, is represented by the Vesica Piscis, the bladder of the fish, and this shape is continually exhibited in many church windows and in the episcopal ring. [\u201dIXO*YC, which means fish and very aptly symbolizes Christ.\u201d The Ring and the Book. The word is a Notariqon of Iesous Christos Theou Huios Soter (Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour.)] \n\nIn the mythology of Yucatan it was the \u201cold ones covered with feathers that came up out of the sea\u201d. Some have seen in this tradition a reference to the fact that man is a marine animal; our breathing apparatus still possesses atrophied gills. \n\n\nHoor-Pa-Kraat \n\n[The Fool is also, evidently, an aspect of Pan; but this idea is shewn in his fullest development by Atu XV, whose letter is the semi-vowel A\u2019ain, cognate with Aleph.]\n\nArriving at highly sophisticated theogony, there appears a perfectly clear and concrete symbol of this doctrine. Harpocrates is the God of Silence; and this silence has a very special meaning. (See attached essay, Appendix.) The first is Kether, the pure Being invented as an aspect of pure Nothing. In his manifestation, he is not One, but Two; he is only One because he is 0. He exists; Eheieh, his divine name, which signifies \u201cI Am\u201d or \u201cI shall Be\u201d, is merely another way of saying that he Is Not; because One leads to nowhere, which is where it came from. So the only possible manifestation is in Two, and that manifestation must be in silence, because the number 3, the number of Binah-Understanding-has not yet been formulated. In other words, there is no Mother. All one has is the impulse of this manifestation; and that must take place in silence. That is to say, there is as yet no more than the impulse, which is unformulated; it is only when it is interpreted that it becomes the Word, the Logos. (See Atu I.)\n\nNow consider the traditional form of Harpocrates. He is a babe, that is to say, innocent, and not yet arrived at puberty; a simpler form of Parsifal, he is represented as rose pink in colour. It is dawn- the hint of light about to come, but not by any means that light; he has a lock of black hair curling around his ear, and that is the influence of the Highest descending upon the Brahmarandra Chakra. The ear is the vehicle of Akasha, Spirit. This is the only salient symbol; it is the only indication that he is not merely the bald baby, because it is the only colour in the blob of rose pink. But, on the other hand, his thumb is either against his lower lip or in his mouth; which it is, one cannot say. There is here a quarrel between two schools of thought; if be is pushing up his lower lip, he emphasizes silence as silence; if his thumb is in his mouth, it emphasizes the doctrine of Eheieh: \u201cI shall Be\u201d. Yet in the end these doctrines are identical.\n\nThis babe is in an egg of blue, which is evidently the symbol of the Mother. This child has, in a way, not been born; the blue is the blue of space; the egg is sitting upon a lotus, and this lotus grows on the Nile. Now, the lotus is another symbol of the Mother, and the Nile is also a symbol of the Father, fertilizing Egypt, the Yoni. (But also the Nile is the home of Sebek the crocodile, who threatens Harpocrates.)\n\nYet Harpocrates is not always thus represented. He is shown by certain schools of thought as standing; he is standing upon the crocodiles of the Nile. (Refer above to the crocodile, the symbol of two exactly opposite things.) There is here an analogy. One is reminded of Hercules-the infant Hercules-who spun the wheel in the House of Women; of Hercules, who was a strong man, who was innocent, who was ultimately a madman, who destroyed his wife and children. It is a cognate symbol.\n\nHarpocrates is (in one sense) the symbol of the Dawn on the Nile, and of the physiological phenomenon which accompanies the act of waking. One sees, at the other end of the octave of thought, the connection of this symbol with the succession to the royal power described above. The symbol of Harpocrates itself tends to be purely philosophical. He is also the mystical absorption of the work of creation; the H\u00e9 final of Tetragrammaton. Harpocrates is, in fact, the passive side of his twin, Horus. Yet at the same time he is a very fully-fledged symbol of this idea, which is wind, which is air, the impregnation of the Mother Goddess. He is immune from all attack because of his innocence; for in this innocence is perfect silence, which is the essence of virility. \n\nThe egg is not only Akasha, but the original egg in the biological sense. [The Black Egg of the element of Spirit in some Hindu schools of thought. From it the other elements Air, Water, Earth, Fire (in that order) proceed.] This egg issues from the lotus, which is the symbol of the Yoni.\n\nThere is an Asiatic symbol cognate with Harpocrates, and though it does not come directly into this card it must be considered in connection with it. That symbol is the Buddha-Rupa. He is most frequently represented sitting on a lotus, and often there is behind him spread the hood of the Serpent; the shape of this hood is again the Yoni. (Note the usual ornaments of this hood; phallic and fructiform.)\n\nThe crocodile of the Nile is called Sebek or Mako-the Devourer. In the official rituals, the idea is usually that of the fisherman, who wishes protection from the assaults of his totem animal.\n\nThere is, however, an identity between the creator and the destroyer. In Indian mythology, Shiva fulfils both functions. In Greek mythology, the god Pan is addressed \u201cPamphage, Pangenetor\u201d, all-devourer, all-begetter. (Note that the numerical value of the word Pan is 131, as is that of Samael, the Hebrew destroying angel.)\n\nSo also, in the initiated symbolism, the act of devouring is the equivalent of initiation; as the mystic would say, \u201cMy soul is swallowed up in God\u201d. (Compare the symbolism of Noah and the Ark, Jonah and the Whale, and others.) [Note the N of Jonah, and the meaning of the name: a dove.]\n\nOne must constantly keep in mind the bivalence of every symbol. Insistence upon either one or other of the contradictory attributions inherent in a symbol is simply a mark of spiritual incapacity; and it is constantly happening, because of prejudice. It is the simplest test of initiation that every symbol is understood instinctively to contain this contradictory meaning in itself. Mark well the passage in The Vision and the Voice, page 136:\n\n\u201cIt is shown me that this heart is the heart that rejoiceth, and the serpent is the serpent of Da\u2019ath, for herein all the symbols are interchangeable, for each one containeth in itself its own opposite. And this is the great Mystery of the Supernals that are beyond the Abyss. For below the Abyss, contradiction is division; but above the Abyss, contradiction is Unity. And there could be nothing true except by virtue of the contradiction that is contained in itself.\u201d\n\nIt is characteristic of all high spiritual vision that the formulation of any idea is immediately destroyed or cancelled out by the arising of the contradictory. Hegel and Nietzsche had glimmerings of the idea, but it is described very fully and simply in the Book of Wisdom or Folly. (See citation, below, Appendix.)\n\nThis point about the crocodile is very important, because many of the traditional forms of \u201cThe Fool\u201d of the Tarot show the crocodile definitely. In the commonplace interpretation of the card, the Scholiasts say that the picture is that of a gay, careless youth, with a sack full of follies and illusions, dancing along the edge of a precipice, unaware that the tiger and crocodile shown in the card are about to attack him. It is the view of the Little Bethel. But, to initiates, this crocodile helps to determine the spiritual meaning of the card as the return to the original Qabalistic zero; it is the \u201cHe\u2019 final\u201d process in the magical formula of Tetragrammaton. By a flick of the wrist, she can be transmuted to reappear as the original Yod, and repeat the whole process from the beginning.\n\nThe innocence-virility formula is again suggested by the introduction of the crocodile, for that was one of the biological superstitions on which they founded their theogony---that the crocodile, like the vulture, had some mysterious method of reproduction. \n\nZeus Arrhenothelus \n\nIn dealing with Zeus, one is immediately confronted with this deliberate confusion of the masculine and the feminine. In the Greek and Latin traditions the same thing happens. Dianus and Diana are twins and lovers; as soon as one utters the feminine, it leads on to the identification with the masculine, and vice versa, as must be the case in view of the biological facts of nature. It is only in Zeus Arrhenothelus that one gets the true Hermaphroditic nature of the symbol in unified form. This is a very important fact, especially for the present purpose, because images 6f this god recur again and again in alchemy. It is hardly possible to describe this lucidly; the idea pertains to a faculty of the mind which is \u201cabove the Abyss\u201d; but all two-headed eagles with symbols clustering about them are indications of this idea. The ultimate sense seems to be that the original god is both male and female, which is, of course, the essential doctrine of the Qabalah; and the thing most difficult to understand about the later debased Old Testament tradition, is that it represents Tetragrammaton as masculine, in spite of the two feminine components.\n\n[It was a tribal necessity of the savage wanderers to have an uncivilized and simple Demiurge for god; the complexities and refinements of settled nations were to them mere weakness. Observe that the moment they got a Promised Land and a Temple, under Solomon, he went \u201can-whoring after strange women\u201d and gods. This infuriated the Diehard prophets, and led within a few years to the breach between Judah and Israel, thence to a whole sequence of disasters.]\n\nZeus became too popular, and, in consequence, too many legends gathered around him; but the important fact for this present purpose is that Zeus was peculiarly the Lord of Air. [The earliest accounts relate the distribution of the three active elements as Dis (Pluto) to Fire, Zeus (Jupiter) to Air, and Poseidon (Neptune) to Water.] Men who sought the origin of Nature in the earliest days tried to find this origin in one of the Elements. (The history of philosophy describes the controversy between Anaximander and Zenocrates; later, Empedocles.) It may be that the original authors of the Tarot were trying to promulgate the doctrine that the origin of everything was Air. Yet if this were so, it would upset the whole Tarot as we know it, since the order of origin makes Fire the first father. It is Air as Zero that reconciles the antinomy.\n\nDianus and Diana, it is true, were symbols of the air, and the Sanskrit Vedas say that the storm gods were the original gods. Yet, if the storm gods really presided over the formation of the Universe as we know it, they were certainly storms of fire; to this astronomers agree. But this theory certainly implies an identification of air and fire, and it seems as if they were thought of as before Light, that is, the Sun; before creative energy, that is, the phallus; and this idea continually suggests itself, that there is here some doctrine contrary to our own most reasonable doctrine: one in which the original confusion of the elements, the Tohu-Bohu, is to be put forward as the cause of order, instead of as a plastic mass on which order imposes itself.\n\nNo system truly Qabalistic makes air in the conventional sense the original element, though Akasha is the egg of spirit, the black or dark blue egg. This suggests a form of Harpocrates. In that case, by \u201cair\u201d one really means \u201cspirit\u201d. However this may be, the actual symbol is perfectly clear, and should be applied to its proper place. \n\nDionysus Zagreus. Bacchus Diphues. \n\nIt is convenient to treat the two gods as one. Zagreus is only important to the present purpose because he possesses horns, and because (in the Eleusinian Mysteries) it is said that he was torn to pieces by the Titans. But Athena rescued his heart and carried it to his father, Zeus. His mother was Demeter; he is thus the fruit of the marriage of Heaven and Earth. This identifies him as the Vau of Tetragrammaton, but the legends of his \u201cdeath\u201d refer to initiation, which accords with the doctrine of the Devourer. \n\nIn this card, however, the traditional form is much more clearly expressive of Bacchus Diphues, who represents a more superficial form of worship; the ecstasy characteristic of the god is more magical than mystical. The latter demands the name Iacchus, whereas Bacchus had Semele for a mother, who was visited by Zeus in the form of a flash of lightning which destroyed her. But she was already pregnant by him, and Zeus saved the child. Until puberty, he was hidden in the \u201cthigh\u201d (i.e., the phallus) of Zeus. Hera, in revenge for her husband\u2019s infidelity with Semele, drove the boy mad. This is the direct connection with the card.\n\nThe legend of Bacchus is, first of all, that he was Diphues, double-natured, and this appears to mean more bisexual than hermaphroditic. His madness is also a phase of his intoxication, for he is pre-eminently the god of the vine. He goes dancing through Asia, surrounded by various companions, all insane with enthusiasm; they carry staffs headed with pine cones and entwined with ivy; they also clash cymbals, and in some legends are furnished with swords, or twined about with serpents. All the half-gods of the forest are the male companions of the Maenad women. In his pictures his drunken face, and the languid state of his lingam, connect him with the legend already mentioned about the crocodile. His constant attendant is the tiger; and, in all the best extant examples of the card, the tiger or panther is represented as jumping upon him from behind, while the crocodile is ready to devour him in front. In the legend of his journey through Asia, he is said to have ridden on an ass, which connects him with Priapus, who is said to have been his son by Aphrodite. It also reminds one of the triumphal entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. It is curious, too, that, at the fabled birth of Jesus, the Virgin Mother is represented as being between an ox and an ass, and one remembers that the letter Aleph means Ox.\n\nIn the worship of Bacchus there was a representative of the god, and he was chosen for his quality as a young and virile, but effeminate man. In the course of the centuries, the worship naturally became degraded; other ideas joined themselves to the original form; and, partly because of the orgiastic character of the ritual, the idea of the Fool took definite shape. Hence, he came to be represented with a Fool\u2019s cap, evidently phallic, and clad in motley, which again recalls the coat of many colours worn by Jesus, and by Joseph. This symbolism is not only Mercurial, but Zodiacal; Joseph and Jesus, with twelve brothers or twelve disciples, equally represent the sun in the midst of the twelve signs. It was only very much later that any alchemical significance was attributed to this, and that at a time when the Renaissance scholars made rather a point of finding something serious and important in symbols which were, in reality, quite frivolous. \n\nBaphomet \n\nThere is no doubt that this mysterious figure is a magical image of this same idea, developed in so many symbols. Its pictorial correspondence is most easily seen in the figures of Zeus Arrhenothelus and Babalon, and in the extraordinarily obscene representations of the Virgin Mother which are found among the remains of early Christian iconology. The subject is dealt with at considerable length in Payne Knight, where the origin of the symbol and the meaning of the name is investigated. Von Hammer-Purgstall was certainly right in supposing Baphomet to be a form of the Bull-god, or rather, the Bull-slaying god, Mithras; for Baphomet should be spelt with an \u201cr\u201d at the end; thus it is clearly a corruption meaning \u201cFather Mithras\u201d. There is also here a connection with the ass, for it was as an ass-headed god that he became an object of veneration to the Templars.\n\nThe Early Christians also were accused of worshipping an ass or ass-headed god, and this again is connected with the wild ass of the wilderness, the god Set, identified with Saturn and Satan. (See infra, Atu XV.) He is the South, as Nuit is the North: the Egyptians had a Desert and an Ocean in those quarters.\n\n\nSummary \n\nIt has seemed convenient to deal separately with these main forms of the idea of the Fool, but no attempt has been made, or should be made, to prevent the legends overlapping and coalescing. The variations of expression, even when contradictory in appearance, should lead to an intuitive apprehension of the symbol by a sublimation and transcendance of the intellectual. All these symbols of the Trumps ultimately exist in a region beyond reason and above it. The study of these cards has for its most important aim the training of the mind to think clearly and coherently in this exalted manner.\n\nThis has always been characteristic of the methods of Initiation as understood by the hierophants.\n\nIn the confused, dogmatic period of Victorian materialisation, it was necessary for science to discredit all attempts to transcend the rationalist mode of approach to reality; yet it was the progress of science itself that has reintegrated these differentials. From the very beginning of the present century, the practical science of the mechanician and the engineer has been forced further and further towards finding its theoretical justification in mathematical physics.\n\nMathematics has always been the most severe, abstract, and logical of the sciences. Yet even in comparatively early schoolboy mathematics, cognisance must be taken of the unreal and the irrational. Surds and infinite series are the very root forms of advanced mathematical thought. The apotheosis of mathematical physics is now the admission of failure to find reality in any single intelligible idea. The modern reply to the question \u201cWhat is anything?\u201d is that it is in relation to a chain of ten ideas, any one of which can only be interpreted in terms of the rest. The Gnostics would undoubtedly have called this a \u201cchain of ten aeons\u201d. These ten ideas must by no means be considered as aspects of some reality in the background. As the supposed straight line which was the framework of calculation has turned out to be a curve, so has the point which had always been taken as the type of existence, become the ring.\n\nIt is impossible to doubt that there is here a continually closer approximation of the profane science of the outer world to the sacred wisdom of the Initiate. \n \n\n* * * \n \n\nThe design of the present card resumes the principal ideas of the above essays. The Fool is of the gold of air. He has the horns of Dionysus Zagreus, and between them is the phallic cone of white light representing the influence from the Crown [Kether: see the position of the Path of Aleph on the Tree of Life.] upon him. He is shown against the background of air, dawning from space; and his attitude is that of one bursting unexpectedly upon the world.\n\nHe is clad in green, according to the tradition of Spring; but his shoes are of the phallic gold of the sun. In his right hand he bears the wand, tipped with a pyramid of white, of the All-Father. In his left hand he bears the flaming pine- cone, of similar significance, but more definitely indicating vegetable growth; and from his left shoulder hangs a bunch of purple grapes. Grapes represent fertility, sweetness, and the basis of ecstasy. This ecstasy is shown by the stem of the grapes developing into rainbow - hued spirals. The Form of the Universe.\n\nThis suggests the Threefold Veil of the Negative manifesting, by his intervention, in divided light. Upon this spiral whorl are other attributions of godhead; the vulture of Maut, the dove of Venus (Isis or Mary), and the ivy sacred to his devotees. There is also the butterfly of many-coloured air and the winged globe with its twin serpents, a symbol which is echoed and fortified by the twin infants embracing on the middle spiral. Above them hangs the benediction of three flowers in one. Fawning upon him is the tiger; and beneath his feet in the Nile with its lotus stems crouches the crocodile. Resuming all his many forms and many-coloured images in the centre of the figure, the focus of the microcosm is the radiant sun. The whole picture is a glyph of the creative light. \n\n\ni. SILENCE \n\n[From Little Essays toward Truth.] \n\nOf all the magical and mystical virtues, of all the graces of the Soul, of all the attainments of the Spirit, none has been so misunderstood, even when at all apprehended, as Silence.\n\n\nIt would not be possible to enumerate the common errors; nay, it may be said that to think of it at all is in itself an error; for its nature is Pure Being, that is to say, Nothing, so that it is beyond all intellection or intuition. Thus, then, the utmost of our Essay can be only a certain Wardenship, as it were a Tyling of the Lodge wherein the Mystery of Silence may be consummated.\n\nFor this attitude there is sound traditional authority; Harpocrates, God of Silence, is called \u201cThe Lord of Defence and Protection\u201d.\n\nBut His nature is by no means that negative and passive silence which the word commonly connotes; for He is the All-Wandering Spirit, the Pure and Perfect Knight-Errant, who answers all Enigmas, and opens the closed Portal of the King\u2019s Daughter. But Silence in the vulgar sense is not the answer to the Riddle of the Sphinx; it is that which is created by that answer. For Silence is the Equilibrium of Perfection; so that Harpocrates is the omniform, the universal Key to every Mystery soever. The Sphinx is the \u201cPuzzel or Pucelle\u201d, the Feminine Idea to which there is only one complement, always different in form, and always identical in essence. This is the signification of the Picture of the God; it is shown more clearly in His adult form as the Fool of the Tarot and as Bacchus Diphues, and without equivocation when He appears as Baphomet.\n\nWhen we enquire more closely into His symbolism. The first quality which engages our attention is doubtless His innocence. Not without deep wisdom is He called Twin of Horns: and this is the Aeon of Horus: it is He who sent forth Aiwass His minister to proclaim its advent. The Fourth Power of the Sphinx is Silence; to us, then, who aspire to this power :as the crown of our Work, it will be of utmost value to attain His innocence in all its fullness. We must understand, first of all, that the root of Moral Responsibility, on which man stupidly prides himself as distinguishing him from the other animals, is Restriction, which is the Word of Sin. Indeed, there is truth in the Hebrew fable, that the knowledge of Good and Evil brings forth Death. To regain Innocence is to regain Eden.\n\nWe must learn to live without the murderous consciousness that every breath we draw swells the sails which bear our frail vessels to the Port of the Grave. We must cast out Fear by Love; seeing that every Act is an Orgasm, their total issue cannot be but Birth. Also, Love is the law: thus every act must be Righteousness and Truth. By certain Meditations this may be understood and established; and this ought to be done so thoroughly that we become unconscious of our Sanctification, for only then is Innocence made perfect. This state is, in fact, a necessary condition of any proper contemplation of what we are accustomed to consider the first task of the Aspirant, the solution of the question. \u201cWhat is my True Will?\u201d For until we become innocent, we are certain to try to judge our Will from the outside, whereas True Will should spring, a fountain of Light, from within, and flow unchecked, seething with Love) into the Ocean of Life.\n\nThis is the true idea of Silence; it is our Will which issues, perfectly elastic, sublimely Protean, to fill every interstice of the Universe of Manifestation which it meets in its course. There is no gulf too great for its immeasurable strength, no strait too arduous for its imperturbable subtlety. It fits itself with perfect precision to every need; its fluidity is the warrant of its fidelity. Its form is always varied by that of the particular imperfection which it encounters: its essence is identical in every event. Always the effect of its action is Perfection, that is, Silence; and this Perfection is ever the same, being perfect; yet ever different, because each case presents its own peculiar quantity and quality.\n\nIt is impossible for inspiration itself to sound a dithyramb of Silence; for each new aspect of Harpocrates is worthy of the music of the Universe throughout Eternity. I have simply been led by my loyal Love of that strange Race among whom I find myself incarnate to indite this poor stanza of the infinite Epic of Harpocrates as being the facet of His fecund Brilliance which has refracted the most needful light upon mine own darkling Entrance to His shrine of fulminating, of ineffable Godhead. \nI praise the luxuriant Rapture of Innocence, the virile and pantomorphous Ecstasy of All-Fulfillment; I praise the Crowned and Conquering Child whose name is Force and Fire, whose subtlety and strength make sure serenity, whose energy and endurance accomplish the Attainment of the Virgin of the Absolute; who, being manifested, is the Player upon the sevenfold pipe, the Great God Pan, and, being withdrawn into the Perfection that he willed, is Silence. \n\nii. DE SAPIENTIA ET STULTITIA \n[From Liber Aleph: The Book of Wisdom or Folly.]\n\nO, my Son, in this the Colophon of mine Epistle will I recall the Title and Superscription thereof; that is, the Book of Wisdom or Folly. I proclaim Blessing and Worship unto Nuith our Lady and her Lord, Hadith, for the Miracle of the Anatomy of the Child Ra-Hoor-Khuit, as it is shewed in the design Minutum Mundum, the Tree of Life. For though Wisdom be the Second Emanation of His Essence, there is a path to separate and to join them, the Reference thereof being Aleph, that is One indeed, but also an Hundred and Eleven in his full Orthography; to signify the Most Holy Trinity. And by metathesis it is Thick Darkness, and Sudden Death. This is also the Number of AUM, which is AMOUN, and the Root-Sound of OMNE or, in Greek, PAN; and it is a Number of the Sun.\n\nYet is the Atu of Thoth that correspondeth thereunto marked with ZERO, and its Name is MAT, whereof I have spoken formerly, and its Image is The Fool. O, my son, gather thou all these Limbs together into one Body, and breathe upon it with thy Spirit, that it may live; then do thou embrace it with Lust of thy Manhood, and go in unto it, and know it; so shall ye be One Flesh. Now at last in the Reinforcement and Ecstasy of this Consummation thou shalt wit by what Inspiration thou didst choose thy Name in the Gnosis, I mean PARZIVAL, \u201cder reine Thor\u201d, the True Knight that won Kingship in Monsalvat, and made whole the Wound of Amfortas, and ordered Kundry to Right Service, and regained the Lance, and revived the Miracle of the Sangraal; yea, also upon himself did he accomplish his Word in the end:\n\n\u201cH\u00f6chsten Heiles Wunder! Erl\u00f6sung dem Erl\u00f6ser!\u201d\n\nThis is the last Word of the Song that thine Uncle Richard Wagner made for Worship of this Mystery. Understand thou this, O my Son, as I take leave of thee in this Epistle, that the Summit of Wisdom is the Opening of the Way that leadeth unto the Crown and Essence of all, to the Soul of the Child Horus, the Lord of the Aeon. This is the Path of the Pure Fool. \n\nDE ORACULO SUMMO \nAnd who is this Pure Fool? Lo, in the Sagas of Old Time, Legend of Scald, of Bard, of Druid, cometh he not in Green like Spring? O thou Great Fool, thou Water that art Air, in whom all complex is resolved! Yea, thou in ragged Raiment, with the Staff of Priapus and the Wineskin! Thou standest upon the Crocodile, like Hoor-pa-Kraat; and the Great Cat leapeth upon Thee! Yea, and more also, I have known Thee who Thou art, Bacchus Diphues, none and two, in thy name IAO! Now at the End of all do I come to the Being of Thee, beyond By-coming, and I cry aloud my Word, as it was given unto Man by thine Uncle Alcofribas Nasier, the oracle of the Bottle of BACBUC. And this Word is TRINC. \n\n\niii. DE HERBA SANCTISSIMA ARABICA\n\n\nRecall, O my Son, the Fable of the Hebrews, which they brought from the City Babylon, how Nebuchadnezzar the Great King, being afflicted in his Spirit, did depart from among Men for Seven Years\u2019 space, eating Grass as doth an Ox. Now this Ox is the letter Aleph, and is that Atu of Thoth whose number is Zero, and whose Name is Maat, Truth; or Maut, the Vulture, the All-Mother, being an Image of Our Lady Nuith, but also it is called the Fool, which is Parsifal, \u201cder reine Thor\u201d, and so referreth to him that walketh in the Way of the Tao. Also he is Harpocrates, the Child Horus walking (as saith Daood, the Badawi that became King, in his Psalmody) upon the Lion and the Dragon; that is, he is in Unity with his own Secret Nature, as I have shewn thee in my Word concerning the Sphinx.\n\nO my Son, yester Eve came the Spirit upon me that I also should eat the Grass of the Arabians, and by Virtue of the Bewitchment thereof behold that which might be appointed for the Enlightenment of mine Eyes. Now then of this may I not speak, seeing that it involveth the Mystery of the Transcending of Time, so that in One Hour of our Terrestial Measure did I gather the Harvest of an Aeon, and in Ten Lives I could not declare it.\n\nDE QUIBUSDAM MYSTERIIS, QUAE VIDI \nYet even as a Man may set up a Memorial or Symbol to import Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand, so may I strive to inform thine Understanding by Hieroglyph. And here shall thine own experience serve us, because a Token of Remembrance sufficeth him that is familiar with a Matter, which to him that knoweth it not should not be made manifest, no, not in a Year of Instruction. Here first then is one amid the Uncounted Wonders of that Vision: upon a Field blacker and richer than Velvet was the Sun of all Being, alone. Then about Him were little Crosses, Greek, overrunning the Heaven. These changed from Form to Form geometrical, Marvel devouring Marvel, a Thousand Times a Thousand in their Course and Sequence, until by their Movement was the Universe churned into the Quintessence of Light. Moreover at another Time did I behold all things as Bullae, iridescent and luminous, self-shining in every Colour and every Combination of Colour, Myriad pursuing Myriad until by their perpetual Beauty they exhausted the Virtue of my Mind to receive them, and whelmed it, so that I was fain to withdraw myself from the Burthen of that Brilliance. Yet, O my Son, the Sum of all this amounteth not to the Worth of one Dawn-Glimmer of Our True Vision of Holiness. \n\n\nDE QUODAM MODO MEDITATIONIS \nNow for the Chief of that which was granted unto me; it was the Apprehension of those willed Changes or Transmutations of the Mind which lead into Truth, being as Ladders unto Heaven, or so I called them at that Time, seeking for a phrase to admonish the Scribe that attended on my Words, to grave a Balustre upon the Stele of my Working. But I make Effort in vain, O my Son, to record this Matter in Detail; for it is the Quality of this Grass to quicken the Operation of Thought it may be a Thousandfold, and moreover to figure each Step in Images complex and overpowering in Beauty, so that one hath not Time wherein to conceive, much less to utter any Word for a Name of any one of them. Also, such was the Multiplicity of these Ladders, and their Equivalence, that the Memory holdeth no more any one of them, but only a certain Comprehension of the Method, wordless by Reason of its Subtility. Now, therefore, must I make by my Will a Concentration mighty and terrible of my Thought, that I may bring forth this Mystery in Expression. For this Method is of Virtue and Profit; by it mayst thou come easily and with Delight to the Perfection of Truth, it is no Odds from what Thought thou makest the first Leap in thy Meditation, so that thou mayst know how every Road endeth in Monsalvat and the Temple of the Sangraal. \n\nSEQUITUR DE HAC RE \nI believe generally, on Ground both of Theory and Experience, so little as I have, that a Man must first be Initiate, and established in Our Law, before he may use this Method. For in it is an Implication of our Secret Enlightenment, concerning the Universe, how its Nature is utterly Perfection. Now every Thought is a Separation, and the Medicine of that is to marry Each One with its Contradiction, as I have shewed formerly in many Writings. And thou shalt clap the one to the other with Vehemence of Spirit, swiftly as Light itself, that the Ecstasy be Spontaneous. So therefore it is expedient that thou have travelled already in this Path of Antithesis, knowing perfectly the Answer to every Griph or Problem, and thy Mind ready there with. For by the Property of this Grass all passeth with Speed incalculable of Wit, and an Hesitation should confound thee, breaking down thy Ladder, and throwing back thy Mind to receive Impression from Environment, as at thy first Beginning. Verily, the Nature of this Method is Solution, and the Destruction of every Complexity by Explosion of Ecstasy, as every Element thereof is fulfilled by its Correlative, and is annihilated (since it loseth separate Existence) in the Orgasm that is consummated within the Bed of thy Mind. \n\nSEQUITUR DE HAC RE \nThou knowest right well, O my Son, how a Thought is imperfect in two Dimensions, being separate from its Contradiction, but also constrained in its Scope, because by that Contradiction we do not (commonly) complete the Universe, save only that of its Discourse. Thus if we contrast Health with Sickness, we include in their Sphere of Union no more than one Quality that may be predicted of all Things. Furthermore, it is for the most Part not easy to find or to formulate the true Contradiction of any Thought as a positive Idea, but only as a Formal Negation in vague Terms, so that the ready Answer is but Antithesis. Thus to \u201cWhite\u201d, one putteth not the Phrase \u201cAll that which is not White\u201d, for this is void, formless; it is neither clear, simple, nor positive in Conception; but one answereth \u201cBlack\u201d, for this hath an Image of his Significance. So then the Cohesion of Antitheticals destroyeth them only in Part, and one becometh instantly conscious of the Residue that is unsatisfied or unbalanced, whose Eidolon leapeth in thy Mind with Splendour and Joy unspeakable. Let not this deceive thee, for its Existence proveth its Imperfection, and thou must call forth its Mate, and destroy them by Love, as with the former. This method is continuous, and proceedeth ever from the Gross to the Fine, and from the Particular to the General, dissolving all Things into the One Substance of Light. \n\n\nCONCLUSIO DR HOC MODO SANCTITATIS \nLearn now that Impressions of Sense have Opposites readily conceived, as long to short, or light to dark; and so with Emotions and Perceptions, as Love to Hate, or False to True; but the more Violent the Antagonism, the more is it bound in Illusion, determined by Relation. Thus the Word \u201cLong\u201d hath no Meaning save it be referred to a Standard; but Love is not thus obscure, because Hate is its twin, partaking bountifully of a Common Nature therewith. Now, hear this: it was given unto me in my Visions of the Aethyrs, when I was in the Wilderness of Sahara, by Tolga, upon the Brink of the Great Eastern Erg, that above the Abyss, Contradiction is Unity, and that nothing could be true save by Virtue of the Contradiction that is contained in itself. Behold, therefore, in this Method thou shalt come presently to Ideas of this Order that include in themselves their own Contradiction, and have no Antithesis. Here then is thy Lever of Antinomy broken in thine Hand; yet, being in true Balance, thou mayest soar, passionate and eager, from Heaven to Heaven, by the Expansion of thine Idea, and its Exaltation, or by Concentration as thou understandeth, by Virtue of thy Studies in the Book of the Law, the Word thereof concerning Our Lady Nuith, and Hadith that is the Core of every Star. And this last Going upon thy Ladder is easy, if thou be truly Initiate, for the Momentum of thy Force in Transcendental Antithesis serveth to propel thee, and the Emancipation from the Fetters of Thought that thou hast won in that Praxis of Art maketh the Whirlpool and Gravitation of Truth of Competence to draw thee unto itself. \n\nDE VIA SOLA SOLIS \nThis is the Profit of mine Intoxication of this holy Herb, The Grass of the Arabs, that it hath shewed me this Mystery (with many others), not as a New Light, for I had that aforetime, but by its swift Synthesis and Manifestation of a long Sequence of Events in a Moment. I had Wit to analyze this Method, and to discover its Essential Law, which before had escaped the Focus of the Lens of mine Understanding. Yea, O my Son, there is no True Path of Light, save that which I have formerly made plain; yet in every Path is Profit, if thou be cunning to perceive it and to clasp it. For we win Truth oftentimes by Reflexion, or by the Composition and Selection of an Artist in his Presentation thereof, when else we were blind thereunto, lacking his Mode of Light. Yet were that Art of none avail unless we had already the Root of that Truth in our Nature, and a Bud ready to flower at the Summoning of that Sun. In Witness, nor a Boy nor a Stone hath Knowledge of the Sections of a Cone, and their Properties; but thou mayest teach these to the Boy by right Presentation, because he hath in his Nature those Laws of Mind that are consonant with our Art Mathematical, and hath Need only of Fledging (I may say this), so that he apply them consciously to the Work, when, all being in Truth, that is, in the necessary Relations that rule our Illusion, he cometh in Course to Apprehension."

In the early 1830s, while living in Shoreham, Kent, he produced a series of monochrome works in pen and ink. This is one of his more poetic works, featuring shepherds tending their sleeping flocks of sheep by moonlight. When the picture was later engraved, it was accompanied by these lines from John Milton's Comus (1637):\r\nEvening late, by then the chewing flocks\r\nHad ta'en their suppers of the savouring herb\r\nOf knot-grass dew-besprent\r\nPalmer's work at Shoreham is intensely personal, but has a mystical, even visionary quality comparable to that of William Blake (1757-1827). He was part of a circle of artists, followers of Blake and known as the 'Ancients', including George Richmond (1809-96), Edward Calvert (1799-1883) and Francis Oliver Finch (1802-62). They shunned the contemporary world and retired into a world of music, nostalgia and dreams. The Ancients would stroll together in the countryside by night, gazing at the stars, and were known among the local villagers as 'Extollagers'. The Darent valley appeared to Palmer a perfect, neo-Platonic world and he called it the 'Valley of Vision'. In his pictures he attempted to create an image of pastoral contentment, unaffected by the reality of labour. The characteristic rounded hills of Shoreham, visible in the background of the picture, and the crescent moon were later adopted as motifs by artists of the mid-twentieth century. Often inspired by Milton's poetic evocations, moonlight was a recurring feature in Palmer's work, representing a divine presence in nature.\r\nThe Shoreham works are characterised by a deliberate archaism or primitivism. Stylistically they were influenced by the work of such Northern European artists as Breughel, D\u00fcrer, Lucas Van Leyden and Giulio Bonasone. They were also partly inspired by Blake's illustrations to Ambrose Philips' imitation of Virgil's First Eclogue (1821). Palmer could have been describing his own work when he wrote of the Blake engravings: 'They are visions of little dells, and nooks, and corners of Paradise; models of the exquisitist pitch of intense poetry\u2026There is in all such a mystic and dreamy glimmer as penetrates and kindles the inmost soul' (A.H. Palmer, The Life and Letters of Samuel Palmer, 1892, pp.15-16).\r\nThis work may have been one of a group of what Palmer referred to as 'blacks' which he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1832."

Despite the wider political turmoil, the painting exudes tranquility. Although Constable's signature techniques were not yet fully developed, his commitment to observing nature is already evident in the detailed depiction of the trees and sky.\n\nThe painting guides the viewer's gaze from the foreground, following the river to the distant Dedham church tower, which serves as a clear focal point. The trees on either side of the canvas frame the central image, like a small cameo, further directing attention to the building that would have been a notable feature of Constable's childhood.\n\nThe composition, with the trees in the foreground framing the image to the right, closely resembles the arrangement in Lorrain's work, \"Hagar and the Angel\" (1646). It is probable that Constable was influenced by this piece, which played a formative role in his early appreciation and education of art.\n\nTwenty-six years later, Constable painted a second image of the same view titled \"The Vale of Dedham\" (1828). Although similar in appearance, there are several minor differences that set the two apart, notably the inclusion of figures in the later painting."

He seemed to sense in the destroyed parts of Algonquin what was happening in France and Belgium. Thomson might have been at the front himself, given the bristling hostility and cruelty he depicts in this scene. All told, sixty-six thousand young Canadian men died fighting in the war: nearly everyone in the country had lost a relative or friend or knew someone who had. Thomson was keenly sensitive to this feeling, and he painted it powerfully in this moving, elegiac work."

This garden scene depicts Matisse's model Antoinette Arnoud, his daughter Marguerite, and his dog Lili relaxing at the artist's residence in the Parisian suburb of Issy-les-Moulineaux. Although Matisse's use of sunlight evokes the Impressionists' attraction to painting directly from nature, he focused more on communicating the cool lushness of the scene through adherence to local color. The masklike face of Marguerite, on the right, reflects the artist's long-standing interest in African art and contrasts sharply with the more conventionally rendered face of Antoinette. In this sense, Tea is a logical extension of Matisse's formative work [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse/by-series/five-busts-of-jeanne-vaderin]Heads of Jeannette[/url] (1910-13), in which he progressively abstracted the female visage in a sequence of five bronze sculptures.

I have attempted a restoration of the original color as the arabesque work is now partially destroyed.\" (Letter from Edwin Lord Weeks to George Corliss, 6 September 1882; Archives of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts).\r\n\r\nOne of the best known legends of the Alhambra was that of the three captive princesses, in which a tyrannical Moorish king fathered beautiful triplet daughters, Zayda, Zorayda, and Zorahayda, by his young Spanish wife, whose Christianity he had forced her to renounce. To protect them from suitors when they became of \"a marriagable age,\" as Irving describes it, the king imprisoned the three princesses in a tower in a palatial room, connected to the world beyond only by a window with a view across a ravine toward the gardens of the Generalife on a nearby hill. Entranced by three captive Christian Spanish cavaliers, whom they could see from their window, the princesses eventually conspired with their duenna to elope with the virile and handsome young men, as they themselves fled their Muslim captors. At the last moment, one princess decided to remain behind, as her two sisters lowered themselves out of the great window on a rope ladder and galloped off with their suitors to a new life in Christian Spain. Tragically, the third princess, too timid to join her sisters in escape, pined away in the tower and died at an early age.\r\n\r\nThis painting will be included in the forthcoming Weeks catalogue raisonn\u00e9 being prepared by Dr. Ellen K. Morris. We are grateful to Dr. Morris for her assistance in the cataloguing of this study."

The relatives throw themself to embrace him, the neighbors look out the windows, the boys of the neighborhood greet him from the trees, and a mysterious girl, perhaps the girlfriend left at home, shudders, hidden behind the corner of the house. On the doorstep, now open, the star emblem, a symbol of family pride,  of the soldier sent to defend the Homeland. Rockwell chooses to show everyone's face, even the neighbor climbing on the fence to watch or the worker adjusting the roof, but not the boy's. His face is the joy of those who welcome him. His face is the uniform he wears, his erect posture, his bag clutched in his hand. He is at home, having served well. \n\nThe artist had a passion for red color. All the protagonists have red hair, and the mother with her arms wide open wears a red sweater, above the apron. The father, who takes his pipe from his mouth to open his face in an expression of amazement, has the face of Rockwell. As if the artist wanted to take part in this joy, to say that it is the joy of everyone and each one: see the children return, at the end of the war on the other side of the ocean."

The fish appear to be piled on a grassy knoll near a beach, which Goya has deftly suggested by the foam of a wave breaking diagonally from lower right to upper left. The scene is illuminated by moonlight glinting across the wet, scaly bodies of the fish and reflected in their large, staring eyes. Goya departs from traditional artistic depictions of dead animals, investing his still lifes with great pathos. Parallels can be drawn between Goya's representation of animals and his treatment of human corpses in his riveting series of prints Disasters of War, one of the greatest accusations against the horrors of war."

The artwork portrays a man eating a simple meal of beans, onions, bread, and wine. To convey a rustic feel, Carracci employed broken brushwork, deviating from the flat, polished finish preferred by fine artists during the late 16th century.\n\nCarracci skillfully combined portraiture and still life in the composition, showcasing his ability to unite different elements in a single painting. This candid approach was unique during a time when monumental depictions of biblical figures and posed portraits of the wealthy dominated painting. The lack of composure and level perspective creates a similar effect to a photograph taken from across a table. The beaneater is captured in a spontaneous moment, with blushed cheeks and an open mouth indicating his direct engagement. Although the portrayal may seem unflattering, the level perspective places the viewer on the same social level as the subject, showcasing Carracci's sympathy for the simple daily routines of the working class. This humanistic strategy was innovative during the 16th century, where wealthy commissions dominated portraiture."

Although the painting shows the brush in the left hand, we can assume that it was mirror image, as Manet was right handed. X-ray analysis of this work has shown that Manet painted over a portrait of his wife, Suzanne Leenhoff (Manet), in profile.

There are numerous replicas of the work by other Renaissance painters, and Leonardo's own preliminary sketch of Madonna's head in the Louvre. The Child's awkward posture, however, led some scholars to attribute parts of the painting to Leonardo's pupil Boltraffio. Other clues that contribute to the fact that Leonardo had this painting completed by one of his pupils include the harsh outlines of the Madonna and Child, as well as the plain landscape.\r\n\r\nThis work was painted sometime in the 1480s for the Visconti rulers of Milan and soon passed to the Litta family, in whose possession it would remain for centuries. In 1865, Alexander II of Russia acquired it from Count Litta, quondam minister to St Petersburg, and deposited the painting in the Hermitage Museum, where it has been exhibited to this day. The museum had the painting transferred from wood to canvas. The painting was briefly featured in the 2006 film The Da Vinci Code."

Wilkie asserted that although landscape painting was entirely new to him, the picture was done with the sole object of teaching himself how to \u2018paint an out-door scene with facility\u2019. Wilkie was a great admirer of seventeenth century Dutch landscapes, and this practical scene of work and nature recalls the paintings of Jacob van Ruisdael and Meindert Hobbema, especially in the inclusion of the water-wheel motif."

It was so popular that it needed to be protected from the crowds by a railing, and established Martin's fame.

Martin published mezzotint engravings in 1826 and 1832.\r\n\r\nThe Biblical episode depicted in the painting - Belshazzar's Feast - is described in the Book of Daniel. The Babylonian king Belshazzar is said to have defiled the sacred vessels of the enslaved Israelites by using them to serve wine at a banquet. The feast was then disturbed by the appearance of a divine hand which wrote a glowing inscription on a wall - the writing on the wall - which was interpreted by the prophet Daniel as portent of Belshazzar's doom. Belshazzar was killed that night and Darius the Mede succeeded to his kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe painting is the second piece in a trilogy of paintings by Martin on Mesopotamian themes, starting with his The Fall of Babylon in 1819, and completed with his The Fall of Ninevah in 1828. It was inspired by a conversation with the American artist Washington Allston and perhaps also by a poem by Thomas Smart Hughes.\r\n\r\nIt shows a panoramic view of a cavernous banqueting room with columns to either side decorated with signs of the zodiac. The hall is filled with crowds of feasting Babylonians, and open to the sky, with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon above, and the Tower of Babel and a ziggurat visible in the background, lit by the moon revealed by a break in dark swirling clouds. The architecture is inspired by Egyptian, Babylonian and Indian styles. Dressed in black, Daniel stands at the centre of the foreground, interpreting the supernatural writing on the wall of the hall. Belshazzar recoils in astonishment and dread to his right, and others look on in shock and horror.\r\n\r\nMartin published an accompanying pamphlet with a key to help viewers to interpret the painting and identify the figures and structures. Although popular with the public, Martin's painting was not a critical success. There was appreciation of the magnificent architecture and emotional content, of the scale and bold colours of the work, but criticism of his painterly technique and particularly the execution of the figures. Charles Lamb called it vulgar and bombastic.\r\n\r\nMartin sold the painting to his former master, glass painter William Collins, for 1,000 guineas before the exhibition in 1821, and Collins made Martin agree not to reproduce the painting until Collins sold it. The Duke of Buckingham and Chandos offered Martin 800 guineas; disappointed, he commissioned Martin to paint The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum instead. Collins sent the painting on an extensive tour of Britain, and it was wildly successful. By 1826, the accompanying pamphlet had reached its 45th edition. Martin was preparing to publish an engraved version in 1826 when Collins sued under the agreement not to reproduce the painting. Martin successfully claimed that he was reproducing his preliminary sketches, not the finished work, and versions of his engraving were published in 1826, in 1832, and for his Illustrations of the Bible project in 1835\r\n\r\nThe painting was bought by Liverpool merchant John Naylor in 1848. It was damaged in 1854 on its journey to Naylor's gallery at Leighton Hall near Welshpool, when the cart transporting it was hit by a train, but the painting was quickly repaired. It was rejected by the National Gallery as being too large - 62.5 inches (159 cm) by 98 inches (250 cm) - and is now owned by the Yale Center for British Art."

        "description": "[i]Afterglow (Summer evening)[/i] (1912) was one of the landscapes painted by Frederick McCubbin towards the end of his life. Initially exhibited in 1912 under the title [i]Summer evening[/i], the painting echoes traditions of European landscape painting: the glowing light is reminiscent of the dreamy landscapes by 17th-century painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-lorrain]Claude Lorrain[/url], and the feathery foliage with small figures relate to 18th-century landscapes by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/antoine-watteau]Jean-Antoine Watteau[/url]. McCubbin, who had extensive knowledge of old masters and art history, was conscious of these painting conventions and traditions.\n\nMost notably, [i]Afterglow[/i] was influenced by the imagery of the Roman goddess Diana bathing with her nymphs, especially by the version of the French painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/camille-corot]Camille Corot[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/camille-corot/the-bath-of-diana-1855][i]The Bath of Diana[/i][/url] (ca. 1855). Corot was a pivotal figure in the development of landscape painting and a significant influence on [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionist[/url] painters. McCubbin had long admired Corot\u2019s paintings through reproductions, and his scrapbooks had several black and white illustrations of Corot\u2019s works, including [i]The Bath of Diana[/i]. Corot\u2019s painting shares compositional elements with [i]Afterglow[/i]: in both cases, there are clusters of trees at the edge of the water and bathers. However, unlike Corot, McCubbin only painted one bather entering the water while the other three relax on the grass.\n\nAdditionally, an article on Corot in the magazine, [i]The Studio[/i], featured a black and white image of Corot\u2019s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/camille-corot/bathers-of-the-borromean-isles-1870][i]Bathers of the Borromean Isles[/i][/url] (ca. 1865-1870). McCubbin likely noticed the painting that was similar in subject matter and composition to [i]Afterglow[/i]. Painters, like Corot, had a profound influence on McCubbin. Corot was associated with the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/barbizon-school]Barbizon School[/url], an art movement that advanced the practice of painting outdoors. McCubbin was among the prominent members of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/heidelberg-school]Heidelberg School[/url] - a group of Australian painters that organized artist\u2019s camps at the outskirts of Melbourne in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Following the model of the Barbizon School, they would pitch their tents near a creek and paint quickly, trying to capture the landscape before the light changed. In that period, McCubbin\u2019s colleagues [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-conder]Charles Conder[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tom-roberts]Tom Roberts[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arthur-streeton]Arthur Streeton[/url], all painted images of nude bathing in the bush.\n\nThe landscape in [i]Afterglow[/i] is a specific place: Lake Strathmore on \u2018Ard Chielle\u2019, a property near McCubbin\u2019s cottage on Mount Macedon. Even though McCubbin absorbed the influences of European painting, his landscapes celebrated the unique beauty of the Australian bush. McCubbin\u2019s style in late paintings like [i]Afterglow[/i] was much freer, his brushwork was looser and bolder, and he even used a broad palette knife to apply dots of color. This new approach was inspired by his first and only trip to Europe in 1907, where he closely observed works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-turner]J.M.W Turner[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet]Claude Monet[/url]. After painting the landscape, McCubbin completed the work in his studio, where he added the female figures. These were likely painted from sketches that were drawn beforehand. As the title suggests, McCubbin wanted to direct attention to the light and its effects: how it lingers in the sky towards the end of the day and how it softly glistens on the foliage and the flesh."

It was considered an affront to the times, not only because of the stark nudity of the woman in contrast to the men but also because Manet used familiar models for the figures in the painting. The nude woman is a combination of both his wife, Suzanne Leenhoff, and one of his other female models, Victorine Meurent. The men, on the other hand, are his brother, Eugene Manet, and his brother in law, Ferdinand Leenhoff. It was also considered controversial because it illustrated the rampant prostitution in Paris at the time, which was a taboo subject just to mention, much less display in an oversized canvas. "

Moore's famous poem, \"The Night Before Christmas.\" Just as she rose to and ultimately mastered the challenge of painting interiors, Moses\u2014even at the age of nearly 100\u2014was ready to risk something completely untried. Unfortunately, she did not live to see the publication of The Night Before Christmas, which appeared in 1962 and remained more or less continuously in print for the next three decades.\r\n\r\nWhile many of the Night Before Christmas illustrations dutifully follow the text of the poem, So Long Till Next Year is pure fantasy on Moses' part. Not actually published in the original edition of the book, it is nonetheless in many ways the quintessential Christmas painting by an artist who was famous for such subjects. Unlike most of Moses' snowscapes, which are clearly grounded in nature, the blue background of So Long Till Next Year immediately informs us that we are in the realm of the imagination. The scenery is etched on this background in a frosty filigree, like icicles on a window pane. Above all, So Long Till Next Year demonstrates Moses' exceptional flexibility and versatility."

[i]Snap the Whip[/i], one of Homer's most beloved works, evoked nostalgia for the nation's agrarian past as the population shifted to cities. Released from their lessons, the exuberant bare-footed boys engage in a spirited game of snap the whip, which required teamwork, strength, and calculation\u2014all important skills for a reuniting country. Their clothing, more specifically their caps, suspenders, and short pants, reflects the true late 1800 American attire. \n\nFeatured in the background is the familiar little red schoolhouse; the school teachers in the distance are most likely meant to be supervising the usual recess activity. The scenic landscape of trees and wildflowers bordering a small field is so realistic that the viewer can almost hear the chirping of the birds and the buzzing of the insects. The boys' bare feet signal childhood's freedom, but their suspenders are associated with manhood's responsibilities. Observed from right to left, Homer's boys hang on to one another, strain to stay connected, run in perfect harmony, and fall away, enacting all the possible scenarios for men after the Civil War.\n\nArt historian Edward Lucie-Smith described in his text, American Realism, \"Childhood and the life of children took on a special significance in America in the years following the Civil War, and these images symbolized the will to rebuild and to make a stronger and more vigorous nation.\" Subtle allusions to the lost generation of Civil War soldiers, the young widows left behind along with the hopes for the next generation provide the underlying narrative of these post-war works which focus on the lives of young teachers and their students.\n\nAn earlier, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/winslow-homer/snap-the-whip-1872-0]larger version of this subject (Butler Institute of American Art)[/url] was among the most celebrated paintings at the 1876 Centennial International Exhibition, held in Philadelphia\u2014America's first world's fair.

        "description": "In March 1916 MacDonald exhibited The Tangled Garden at the Ottawa Society of Artists. though derided by art critics of the day, it was a fairly conventional post-impressionistic painting of sunflowers, one that has much in common with Van Gogh's treatment of the subject from nearly forty years before but which Canadian critics rejected. Accustomed to the smooth blending and muted tones of Canadian academic art in the style of the Canadian Art Club, the critics were taken aback by the brightness and intensity of the colours. \"An incoherent mass of color,\" wrote an anonymous reviewer for the Toronto Star. Hostile art critics thereafter singled out MacDonald for attacks in the press."

He was stricken with polio when he was sixteen, and yet overcame his disability through sheer determination and will. He took to drawing on a trip to Europe, where he attended school in Switzerland and Germany. A much traveled artist in his life, Weston absorbed the many influences that surrounded and impacted him, including the color and light of the Middle East, where he served as a hospitality liaison with the British Army in Baghdad, and a secluded one-room cabin and studio that he built near St. Huberts, New York, where he reenergized himself as a painter.\n\nAlthough Harold Weston\u2019s style changed throughout his career, he continually tried to capture the emotional essence of experience. Indeed, for Weston, his sympathetic response to his subject took precedence over depicting visual reality. Winds, Upper Ausable Lake was executed in isolation at the artist\u2019s studio in New York. It typifies Weston\u2019s early expressionist style. Boldly simplified, the painting has exaggerated rhythms and economical imagery that reveal Weston\u2019s reverence for his environment and the painter\u2019s affinity with Marsden Hartley\u2019s art. The painting was included in Weston\u2019s debut exhibition at the Montross Gallery in 1922."

        "description": "Controversial and driven by his own unique vision, Currin is heralded as one of the most important artists of his generation and more specifically in the powerful position of re-directing art history back to discussions of painting's relevance and closing the gap in the disjointed lineage of genre painting. [i]Homemade Pasta[/i] is a major work by the artist, complete with present-day cultural complexities and multiple art historical precedents. \n\nAmerican genre paintings of all types seem to compel Currin. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/norman-rockwell]Norman Rockwell[/url]'s obvious and pleasing narratives, as well as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/maxfield-parrish]Maxfield Parrish[/url]'s glibly stylized works can be seen as precursors to Currin, particularly in their desire to tell a simple and innocent story. In effectively the same format as Rockwell and Parish, Currin seeks to bring a truly contemporary message to his works and interweaves the social, the political and the humorous, at times with impunity.\n\nIn [i]Homemade Pasta[/i], Currin paints a blissfully dull domestic scene-a couple standing in their kitchen engaged in the clichi gourmet act of home-making pasta. The Italian red checkered apron, restaurant-style wire rack shelving, and the semi-professional hand grinder tell the viewers that we are in a late twentieth century urban American kitchen, influenced by the do-it-yourself sophistication of television cooking shows, Martha Stewart and the American desire to embrace international cuisines. In Currin's matter-of-fact rendering, the couple of today is a gay male couple. They are exquisitely realized in perfect detail and Currin's painterly virtuosity is flexed. But contrary to historical imagery of gay male couples (if there is such a thing), they are the antithesis of sexual beings. Currin has been able to demonstrate that the two men share affection for another without actually showing it. \n\nThe subjects in [i]Homemade Pasta[/i] speak to a truism about gay domestic life in the post-AIDS era - cozy at home, yearning for marriage rights, warm guys who seem to vaguely look alike as a side effect of all their years together. While the subjects are utterly ordinary looking, Currin has not forgotten their subtle affectations - thick middles and narrow shoulders, elongated, delicate fingers, hairless faces. The painting is clearly affectionately rendered, but Currin's attention to detail can make even the gay viewer squeamish. So startlingly true to life, it's gay life [i]sans[/i] lifestyle.\n\nAs Currin takes his place in art history, his indelible mark will no doubt be on how he re-affirmed the power of genre painting. By looking at scenes from everyday life with his unique lens of unconventional beauty, Currin brings to light just how socially and aesthetically transgressive turn of the millennium American culture looks. Busty females at the bra shop, nude women of impossible proportions intertwined against a black backdrop, two bare-backed men biblically perched on the back of a fishing boat, a gay couple preparing a meal in their kitchen - Currin is never short on compelling, if even at times archetypal visuals. He true genius however is his capacity to re-convert all of us again to the luscious spectacle of great painting."

The inclusion of the cuy in this painting is due to the difference in cuisine, but also is an example of symbolism: lamb was a sacrificial animal in the Judeo-Christian tradition, but cuy was a sacrificial animal in traditional Inca ceremonies. By using a symbol of sacrifice that was more meaningful to the Peruvian people, the artist makes a statement about the sacrifice in the story of Easter. The spread on the table shows that Jesus and the disciples are enjoying [i]chicha[/i], a Peruvian drink, and native fruits and vegetables such as potatoes, peppers, and corn. It is believed that the artist painted Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus (shown at the bottom of the painting, holding the money bag, dressed in red and looking out at the viewer), to bear a resemblance to Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish conquistador responsible for the fall of the Inca empire."

On the table to her left sits a statue of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, which held particular significance for Kauffman. The artist wore a belt representing the battle between Minerva and Neptune for control of Attica, using the goddess's victory as a reminder of her belief in and support for female power. The sitter, who holds a book and writing implement, is believed by some viewers to be a female intellectual of the time, possibly Catherine Macaulay or Elizabeth Montagu. She exudes confidence, empowerment, and grace, resembling a Roman goddess.\n\nThe portrait endorses the neoclassical style while celebrating the artistic skill and decorum of women. The table on the left, with its carved lion's feet, is indicative of the popular style seen throughout European arts in the eighteenth century. This style was embraced by famous architect Robert Adam and potter Josiah Wedgwood, among others, and was fueled by a contemporary fascination with all things Roman or Greek. Artists like Kauffman explored these curiosities on their European Grand Tours, positioning themselves and the unknown sitter as equals to their male counterparts, equally curious and equally artistic."

        "description": "Thomas Eakins's deep connection to his birthplace remained a theme throughout his career. Perhaps his most well-known and ambitious work for the city of Philadelphia is [i]The Gross Clinic[/i], a painting completed in 1875 that spotlights the local physician Samuel David Gross. An intense scene is large in scale, measuring eight feet wide and over six feet across features Gross's teaching demonstration of a surgical procedure for the medical students. Five other doctors operate on a patient's infected thigh. This scientific endeavor contrasts sharply with the emotional reaction of the lone woman in the scene, presumably the patient's mother. Behind the operation on the right side of the painting, two figures watch the proceedings from the shadow of the room's doorway.\n\nThe painting evokes [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url]'s art historical precedent [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/the-anatomy-lesson-of-dr-nicolaes-tulp-1632][i]The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp[/i][/url] (1632). Much like Rembrandt's version, [i]The Gross Clinic[/i] documents sanitary medical procedures of its time, but the painting's real focus is living figures. Always a portraitist, Eakins calculated the work as a visual record of all the individuals present in the medical theater. Eakins inserted his own likeness among the audience - he's the figure at the far right, sketching. The core of the work is Dr. Gross, as light and composition conspire to attract the eye to the esteemed lecturer.\n\nThis work is one of Eakins' most important, well-known, and controversial paintings. It provides a clear example of his interest in scientific study and medicine. Eakins paid great attention to the technical details of the surgery, and the scene also shows great artistic skill and design in the way that the artist illuminates the otherwise dark scene with a wash of light coming down on the pale skin of the patient and the white sheets on which he rests. Dramatic effect and keen use of color are also demonstrated in the clear bursts of red used to show the blood on the victim's body and the assistants as well as the scalpel held by Dr. Gross.\n\nCompleted for the Centennial Exposition, [i]The Gross Clinic[/i] was intended to be a statement of Eakins's artistic skill. Though the work was rejected by the selection committee, the artist's tactic was overall a success. While some critics lashed out against its gruesome subject matter, seemingly vulgar treatment, and inherent melodrama (note the near-swooning, hysterical woman in the left middle ground), viewers were nonetheless captivated by the work's theatricality. The painting was shown in the U.S. Army Post Hospital exhibition, not the main exhibition space - certainly a snub to the artist. Reactions were mixed with some praising Eakins for his study of anatomy, but most questioning the purpose of the painting and its morbidity. Now [i]The Gross Clinic[/i] is recognized as one of the greatest American paintings ever made. "

It is also one of the two paintings that he created in 1952, both of which dealt with alienated couples. The older couple are believed to represent Hopper and his wife, at that date in their 60s. The hotel guests have been described as being \"both traveling and suspended in time,\" reflecting a stoic and dramatic feeling, reminiscent of the film noir movies Hopper might have seen and the complex structure and feeling of works by Edgar Degas. The painting utilizes harsh light and rigid lines to create a \"carefully constructed\" uncomfortable environment. The elevated and theatrical vantage point of the painting may be derived from Hopper's love of Broadway theatre which he often watched from the balcony."

Her masculine attire also reminds the viewer of early family photographs in which Kahlo chose to wear a suit. The cropped hair also presents a nuanced expression of the artist's identity. She holds one cut braid in her left hand while many strands of hair lie scattered on the floor. The act of cutting a braid symbolizes a rejection of girlhood and innocence, but equally can be seen as the severance of a connective cord (maybe umbilical) that binds two people or two ways of life. Either way, braids were a central element in Kahlo's identity as the traditional [i]La Mexicana[/i], and in the act of cutting off her braids, she rejects some aspect of her former identity.\n\nThe hair strewn about the floor echoes an earlier self-portrait painted as the Mexican folkloric figure [i]La Llorana,[/i] here ridding herself of these female attributes. Kahlo clutches a pair of scissors, as the discarded strands of hair become animated around her feet; the tresses appear to have a life of their own as they curl across the floor and around the legs of her chair. Above her sorrowful scene, Kahlo inscribed the lyrics and music of a song that declares cruelly, \"Look, if I loved you it was for your hair, now that you are hairless, I don't love you anymore,\" confirming Kahlo's own denunciation and rejection of her female roles.\n\nIn likely homage to Kahlo's painting, Finnish photographer [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/elina-brotherus]Elina Brotherus[/url] photographed [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/elina-brotherus/wedding-portraits-1997][i]Wedding Portraits[/i][/url] in 1997.

The horizon of the water is high, and the water is calm and dark. Above it, Harris draws the clouds in blue, yellow, and white, in a succession of horizontal lines, as if the waves were in the sky. Harris gives to us, through this work, the possibility to observe his vision of the northern landscape, towards a universal vision of nature's spiritual power, crossing the naturalistic surface to a more profound reality.\n\nSimplified forms and intense light are the distinctive marks of Lauren Harris's work and with these instruments. Harris wrote: \"T[i]he source of our art then is not in the achievements of other artists in other days and lands, although it has learned a great deal from these, our art is founded on a long and growing love and understanding of the North in an ever clearer experience of oneness with the informing spirit of the whole land and a strange brooding sense of Mother Nature fostering a new race and a new age...

From left to right the instruments may be identified as follows: compass, surveyor's chain, surveyor's rule, harbour signals chart, inclining sundial, fishing float, vertical sundial, glass net float, portable tachometer and auger. With the exception of the two sundials, which probably date from no later than the eighteenth century, the objects would have been in common use in the 1920s. The large red object, around which is draped a string of cork floats, is a ship's lantern (port) \u2018related to the type called Dark Lantern since its light could be shut off by a small door in its side\u2019. She considers that the object identified above as an auger is \u2018an instrument for the cleaning of tubes, being a spiral of brass bristles on a metal stem, the tip of which is blunt\u2019. The artist acquired these and similar objects in a number of ways: some were purchased at ships' chandlers, some he found discarded and others were given to him. Mrs von Bethmann-Hollweg no longer possesses any of the instruments depicted.\r\n\u2018Regalia\u2019 was painted in the artist's studio at Dairy House, Maresfield Park, Sussex in 1928 where he set up the instruments to contrive a still-life composition. Wadsworth was consistent in his practice of painting still-life from the motif but the view of the sea is imaginary. Wadsworth began to paint marine still-lifes in 1926 after a visit to Marseilles. \r\nThe subject of the marine still-life was to preoccupy him above all else until 1929 when his work began to move towards biomorphic abstraction. The vocabulary of the marine still-lifes generally includes both the organic and man-made, natural forms, such as shells, and instruments of measurement such as sundials. It was only in 1928 that he abandoned, temporarily, natural forms. The earlier still-lifes were juxtaposed with harbour scenes, thereby forming a link with the paintings of ships in harbour which directly precede these works, but the still-lifes of 1928 are mostly set against an empty or near-empty seascape. In \u2018Regalia\u2019 the sea is empty but for a small yacht and a buoy, the only indication of movement in an otherwise motionless scene. In 1926 the notion of setting a still-life before a landscape was becoming popular in England and by 1928 it had become typical of Seven and Five Society painting, notably in the work of David Jones, Ben and Winifred Nicholson and Christopher Wood, as well as in that of Paul Nash who was not a member. It was particularly popular on the Continent where de Chirico, Herbin, Metzinger, L\u00e9ger, Matisse and Picasso were prominent practitioners, some of whose work Wadsworth knew in reproduction as early as 1921 as a result of his subscription to L'Esprit nouveau, of which he owned six volumes, and to L\u00e9once Rosenberg's Bulletin de L'Effort Moderne, which he subscribed to from January 1924 until December 1927. \r\n"

The painting\u2019s title is a reference to the practice in private athletic clubs of introducing the contestants to the audience as \u201cboth members\u201d to circumvent the Lewis Law of 1900 that had banned public boxing matches in New York State. Boxing was a controversial subject, but the interracial theme made this painting even more so, especially since the black boxer appears to be winning the match.\n\nIt is likely that Bellows intended Both Members of This Club as an allusion to the recent and much-publicized success of the African American professional prizefighter Jack Johnson, who had won the world heavyweight championship in 1908. The idea of a black boxing champion was so unsettling to the prejudiced social order of the time that many thought interracial bouts should be outlawed. Painted at the height of the Jim Crow era, Bellows\u2019s powerful delineation of a white fighter about to be defeated by a black opponent was an exceptionally daring and provocative piece of social commentary."

The work exists in two versions, a small version in brighter colours with a dark-haired goat and a rainbow, held by Manchester Art Gallery, and a larger version in more muted tones with a light-haired goat held by the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight.\r\nThe painting was the only major work completed by Hunt during his first trip to the Holy Land, to which he had travelled after a crisis of religious faith. Hunt intended to experience the actual locations of the Biblical narratives as a means to confront the relationship between faith and truth. "

        "description": "Previous research has assumed that Kane\u2019s works on paper were sketched from life. However, this oil on paper, Medicine Pipe Stem Dance, was likely painted by Kane after the event, as a study for the later oil painting. It lacks the immediacy of a sketch drawn from life. \r\n          Kane makes no reference in his field journal to the pipe stem dance; if we are to believe his book Wanderings of an Artist among the Indians of North America, the Blackfoot ceremony took place in the afternoon and included Kane as one of the observers in the circle of seated men. (He was invited to the ceremony, as artist, to \u201cadd magical powers in increasing its efficacy.\u201d1) The study spotlights the two dancers, and the vantage point is elevated, giving a more expansive view of dancers, spectators, and landscape. Kane\u2019s depiction of the pipe stems suggests they were inspired by his drawings of individual cultural objects rather than by experience. In this painting Kane has chosen to depict a pipe stem from the very enemy nation (Plains Cree) that the Blackfoot were preparing to engage in battle.2  This seeming inconsistency may well underline Kane\u2019s constructed approach to this work.\r\n          The oil painting based on the study was an early creation in Kane\u2019s cycle of one hundred paintings. The canvas was one of eight \u201cIndian pictures\u201d Kane exhibited at the Upper Canada Provincial Exhibition of 1852 in Brockville. One press account includes a lengthy entry on Medicine Pipe Stem Dance, referring to the \u201cextracts, which we subjoin from Mr Kane\u2019s journal\u201d as a way to \u201cfully explain the picture and superstitions attached to the ceremonial.\u201d3  The entry reads like a detailed ethnological explanation, unlike the comparatively brief account in Wanderings of an Artist. That Kane did not make even a brief reference in his journal to his invitation to this sacred event, combined with the detailed ethnological description in the press review, suggests that Medicine Pipe Stem Dance (both the study and the oil painting) may rely more on descriptions that Kane read than on his own experience."

        "description": "The picture may recall a particularly bad storm in January 1842 though it has not been possible to tie down the exact incident. Despite Turner's title, no ship called Ariel is known to have been lost or involved in a storm in the years immediately preceding 1842, nor is any ship of that name known to have operated out of Harwich at this time. However, Charles Ninnis has suggested that Turner misremembered the name of the Fairy, which did set out from Harwich on 12 November 1840 and sank with all hands in a storm which began the following day and was still raging on 21 November, \u2018the day on which the Princess Royal was born\u2019, as the label on the back of No. 480 has it. Turner is not known to have been at Harwich at the time but could well have witnessed the storm at Margate where he often stayed with Mrs Booth.\r\n\r\nIn addition Adele Holcomb has cast doubts on the veracity of the story that Turner had himself tied to the mast for four hours during the storm; it does indeed bear a suspicious resemblance to accounts of the marine painter Joseph Vernet. However, in the fifth edition of his notes on the Turners on view at Marlborough House, Ruskin added a report of a conversation between the Rev. William Kingsley and Turner in which the artist stressed the truth of the incident and his interest in recording the experience: \u2018I had taken my mother and a cousin to see Turner's pictures, and, as my mother knows nothing about art, I was taking her down the gallery to look at the large \u201cRichmond Park\u201d, but as we were passing the \u201cSnowstorm\u201d she stopped before it, and I could hardly get her to look at any other picture; she told me a great deal more about it than I had any notion of, though I have seen many sea storms. She had been in such a scene on the coast of Holland during the war. When, some time afterwards, I thanked Turner for his permission for her to see his pictures, I told him that he would not guess what had caught my mother's fancy, and then named the picture; and he then said, \u201cI did not paint it to be understood, but I wished to show what such a scene was like; I got the sailors to lash me to the mast to observe it; I was lashed for four hours, and I did not expect to escape, but I felt bound to record it if I did. But no one had any business to like the picture.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d said I, \u201cmy mother once went through just such a scene, and it brought it all back to her.\u201d \u201cIs your mother a painter?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThen she ought to have been thinking of something else.\u201d These were nearly his words; I observed at the time he used \u201crecord\u201d and \u201cpainting\u201d as the title \u201cauthor\u201d had struck me before\u2019\u2014see Turner's sub-title in the R.A. catalogue; Ruskin himself wrote \u2018Note the significant use of this word, instead of \u201cartist\u201d\u2019.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ruskin records Turner's hurt reaction to the criticism (untraced) that the picture was nothing but a mass of \u2018soapsuds and whitewash\u2019: \u2018Turner was passing the evening at my father's house on the day this criticism came out: and after dinner, sitting in his arm-chair by the fire, I heard him muttering to himself at intervals, \u201csoapsuds and whitewash! What would they have? I wonder what they think the sea's like? I wish they'd been in it.\u201d\u2019 (Incidentally Frith, giving evidence at the Whistler versus Ruskin trial in 1878, attributed this criticism to Ruskin himself! See Ruskin, 1903\u201312, xxix, p. 584.) The Athenaeum's review on 14 May was typical of this abuse: \u2018This gentleman has, on former occasions, chosen to paint with cream, or chocolate, yolk of egg, or currant jelly, \u2014here he uses his whole array of kitchen stuff. Where the steam-boat is\u2014where the harbour begins, or where it ends\u2014which are the signals, and which the author in the Ariel...are matters past our finding out.\u2019 Or, as the Art Union for 1 June observed, \u2018Through the driving snow there are just perceptible portions of a steam-boat labouring on a rolling sea; but before any further account of the vessel can be given, it will be necessary to wait until the storm is cleared off a little. The sooner the better.\u2019\r\n\r\nIn Modern Painters Ruskin described the Snowstorm, with two watercolours, as \u2018nothing more than passages of the most hopeless, desolate, uncontrasted greys, and yet ... three of the very finest pieces of colour that have come from his hand\u2019. Later, in a description of the effect of sea after prolonged storm he pointed out that \u2018There is indeed no distinction left between air and sea; that no object, nor horizon, nor any land-mark or natural evidence of position is left ... Suppose the effect of the first sunbeam sent from above to show this annihilation to itself, and you have the sea picture of the Academy, 1842, the Snowstorm, one of the very grandest statements of sea-motion, mist, and light, that has ever been put on canvas, even by Turner. Of course it was not understood; his finest works never are...\u2019 (Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll, The Paintings of J.M.W. Turner, revised ed., New Haven and London 1984)"

        "description": "The monumental painting, [i]The pioneer[/i] (1904) by Frederick McCubbin, is considered one of the greatest masterpieces of Australian art. The artist depicted a pioneering couple in the Australian bush and the progression of their life through three panels. By choosing to paint a triptych, a traditional format used for religious paintings, the artist elevated the status of the pioneers. The choice of subject relates to the rise of Australian nationalism in the years following the Federation of Australia in 1901 (the unification of six separate colonies to the Australian Commonwealth).\n\nThe left panel shows the pioneering couple in their new environment: the man in the background is lighting a fire while the woman sitting has a pensive look, thinking of the road ahead. In the central panel, we see the couple a few years later, the woman is holding a baby, and the man is resting on the log. There is evidence of their hard work. Most of the land has been cleared, and a small cottage is seen in the distance. In the right panel, a bushman is kneeling in front of a grave. The developed city in the background indicates that the image is in the distant future, but it remains unclear who the bushman is and to whom the tomb belongs.\n\n[i]The pioneer[/i] was painted in the bush near McCubbin\u2019s cottage, which he named \u2018Fontainebleau\u2019 as a way of expressing admiration for the French [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/barbizon-school]Barbizon School[/url] of painting, whose members painted outdoors near the Fountainbleu forest. Like the painters of the Barbizon school, McCubbin painted outside to faithfully capture the harsh sunlight and the environment of the bush. Studies of the painting have shown how McCubbin experimented with priming techniques to achieve different effects of color and texture. The central panel of [i]The pioneer[/i] was covered with an extra layer of lead white paint, which added luminosity and texture to the painting. It was also observed that the artist probably used a palette knife to apply dots of paint onto the surface.\n\nIn [i]The pioneer[/i] and other paintings, McCubbin used friends and family as his models. The woman in the left and central panel was his wife, Annie McCubbin, that was about thirty-nine at the time. Accompanying her in the central panel was James Edward, a professional commercial painter that worked around Melbourne. In the left panel, Annie posed with local wood sawyer, Patrick \u2018Paddy\u2019 Watson, who was also depicted in the right panel. The baby Annie held in the central panel was Patrick Watson\u2019s nephew, Jimmy Watson. Moreover, Patrick Watson, along with his brother James, posed for McCubbin\u2019s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederick-mccubbin/bush-sawyers-1910][i]Bush Sawyers[/i][/url] (1910). \n\nMcCubbin first exhibited [i]The pioneer[/i] in 1904 at the Melbourne Athenaeum. Today, it is part of the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne. [i]The pioneer[/i] is considered an iconic image of national significance as it captured the origins and the aspirations of the early pioneers of Australia.  At the same time, the painting has a universal quality by showing the journey and life of a family."

        "description": "During the years of her stay in Scandinavia from 1915 to 1920, the works of Gabriele M\u00fcnter showed a clear stylistic change compared to the period of the 'Blauer Reiter'. Soon after her arrival in Stockholm, M\u00fcnter made contact with the artists of the Swedish avant-garde, such as the married couple Isaac Gr\u00fcnewald and Sigrid Hjerten, as well as Einar Jolin and Leander Engstr\u00f6m. The influence of these Swedish pupils of Henri Matisse with their Fauvist design principles, decorative flat composition and cleverly mixed colors is soon unmistakable in M\u00fcnter's work.\n\nSabine Windecker writes about M\u00fcnter's change in style and choice of subject through the exchange with the Swedish artists: \"Even in the choice of the pictorial themes there is a clear agreement. Not only in Gr\u00fcnewald, Hjerten and Jolin do figure compositions, portraits, interiors and cityscapes represent preferred pictorial themes ... In addition, M\u00fcnter also orientates himself in terms of color and form to the painting style of these artists, because in their pictures there are now echoes of the decorative expressionism of Matisse, in particular his rhythmic use of lines. often in favor of an idealizing representation of people - subordinate to a curved line.\"\n\nIn these years, and well into the next decade, the female portrait in particular became M\u00fcnter's favorite subject. In the spring of 1917, M\u00fcnter created a cycle of large, symbolic portraits with titles such as \"Future\", \"Contemplative\" or \"Sick\", in which the female figure is also the bearer of a psychological message of waiting, hoping, contemplating or suffering. A young Swede of Jewish descent, Gertrude Holz, sat as a model in each of the paintings mentioned and other portraits from this period.\n\nThe picture of the \"Sinnerden\" shows her in a hermetically sealed room, the boundaries of which are cut on all sides by the low landscape format. She sits as a half-length figure, looking thoughtfully past the viewer, close to the front edge of the picture in front of a table with a still-life-like arrangement of flowers, apples and a lamp, which cuts off the pictorial space just as abruptly as the dark green upholstery and the opaque, partially curtained window directly behind it. The head of the \"sensual\", which in contrast to her strikingly abstract body is particularly elaborate, is additionally emphasized by the dull blue flowers behind her. The broken rhythm of the black lines in the two-dimensional overall composition and the cool colors of dark red, green and matt gray mixed with black reinforce the melancholic tone of the depiction and make the connection with M\u00fcnter's own mental state at this time particularly poignant.\n\n[url href=https://www.lenbachhaus.de/en/discover/collection-online/detail/sinnende-30018327]lenbachhaus[/url]"

It is a very human moment, in which the friends and mother of Jesus weep and cry out all their pain before the body of the Crucifix. it was, also, an interesting subject for artists, who have experienced their ability to represent pain in it.\n\nBotticelli painted this work parallel to another [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/lamentation-over-the-dead-christ-1490][i]Lamentation[/i][/url] (1490) now exposed in the Museum Poldi Pezzoli, Milan. At the moment, the artist was fifty years old. \nThe painting that is examined here comes from the Florentine church of San Paolino. Botticelli adopted a very widespread artistic style, to incardinate the work to the church that had commissioned it: St. Paul, with the sword, witnesses the scene as if he had been present at the moment of Christ's death. Together with him St. Jerome, dressed as a hermit, who beats his chest with a stone because in the church of St. Paulinus there was a brotherhood of penitents who financially supported the church. On the right St. Peter, a figure often represented together with St. Paul.\n\nUnlike other Lamentations' set near the Cross, in which the sky and the summit of Golgotha \u200b\u200bis visible, Botticelli sets this in front of the sepulcher: the rocky wall in which it is excavated completely closes the background of the painting, as if to suffocate the space, and to push towards the observer the sound of the silent crying of the people who complain about the body of Jesus. No one screams, in the framework of Botticelli. It is a silent and respectful pain. Christ, naked if not for a transparent cloth that surrounds his hips and back (an extraordinary example of Botticelli's ability in the representation of drapery almost impalpable) is supported by the Madonna, who faints due to the pain in the arms of John the Evangelist. Together with her and the disciple, three women, the three Marie that, on Easter morning, will found the sepulcher empty. Two of them hold Christ\u2019s body: Maria Magdalene blends her head with that of Christ, in a kiss that is the ideal antecedent of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo]Michelangelo[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/pieta][i]Piet\u00e0 Bandini[/i][/url] (c.1455); another Mary caresses the feet of Christ, with her hands and her hair, a memory of the scene in which the prostituted woman washed Christ's feet with perfume; the third, in the background, suffocates her tears in the mantle, covering her face. We can only see her eyes, very serious and full of pain as they observe the three nails extracted from the Cross, still full of the blood of Jesus.\n\nBotticelli also seems to insert a reason for hope: the rock wall of the sepulcher is not homogeneous, it is already broken by the earthquake which, according to the Gospel story, broke out after the death of Jesus. This detail already heralds the resurrection, together with the soft grass, painted thread by line, in which the group of figures walks. Grass absent inside the cave: a fragile sign of rebirth, in which Botticelli gives us his hope that death is not the last word.\n\n[b]by Maddalena Mongera[/b]"

Here we see a good natured, ruddy-cheeked man, lifting up his beer jug as if to show us that his drink has just run out. He wears a greenish-blue long tunic, and the sloping angle of his beret suggests it may be in danger of falling off at any moment. On the table in front of him is a small pipe and some wrapped tobacco.\n\nAs art historian Cynthia Kortenhorst-Von Bogendorf Rupprath tells us, the subject of this painting was popularized by the group of artists known as the Utrecht Carravaggisiti before becoming a subject common among Haarlem painters from the 1620s. The subject's clear enjoyment of smoking and drinking might have suggested both the pleasures of life and the dangers of excess. Many paintings of this period included subtle moralizing messages on the transience of life and its indulgences. In adapting this common theme, Leyster clearly shows her knowledge of contemporaneous painterly trends and the desire to give them her own spin.\n\nThe idea of vice is contrasted to cheerful demeanour of the subject of the painting. The intricate detail of the sitter's face conveys a sense of the individuality and personality that recognizes his enjoyment of his evening (or afternoon) and predicts that he has not had his last drink."

In this painting, Whistler portrays a fireworks display in the night sky, conveying a sense of excitement and celebration. Rather than offering a clear image, the artist's sweeping brushstrokes of dark blues and greens, interrupted by small bursts of bright color, capture the effects of fireworks over the river, exemplifying the Aesthetic principle of \"art for art's sake.\" Whistler described the painting as conveying a \"dreamy, pensive mood\" rather than a narrative.\n\nDespite its significance as an early example of abstraction, The Falling Rocket was not initially well received. Critics questioned the value of the seemingly convoluted subject matter and criticized what they perceived as Whistler's reckless and careless painting technique. The negative review by John Ruskin prompted Whistler to sue for libel, submitting this painting, along with other nocturnes, as evidence. Ruskin's condemnation of Whistler's work as representative of \"the modern school\" proved accurate, as Whistler's technique of flicking paint at the canvas to create the fireworks influenced later modern artists, most notably Jackson Pollock."

After being presented at the first Brera Triennale in 1891, this canvas was kept by the painter and never exhibited again. The pyramidal structure of the figure, which Pellizza would also use in other contemporary portraits such as The Giani Mediator, reveals the study he was already pursuing of Renaissance painting. This is a true-to-life portrait, which is also influenced by the \"topos\" of female portraiture in the second half of the nineteenth century, aimed at highlighting the interiority of the woman and her innocence exposed to risk in a dangerous world, as the title Pensieri (Thoughts) underlines. The figure, wearing an elegant peasant dress and a wedding veil, is seated frontally, looking absorbed and melancholic, while holding white daisies in her lap. The colour range is light and delicate, based on a dominant accord of whites and blues immersed in a diffuse luminous vibration. The image of the girl, through the light, is seamlessly connected to the background environment and achieves virtuoso results in the transparencies of the veil on her forehead. The predilection for the painting of reality was always to be a characteristic of Pellizza, who here was still proceeding in the direction of Fattori and Tallone but who, by approaching Divisionism, was soon to acquire an ideological and philosophical confidence in the name of a socialist realism in harmony with nature.\n\n(source: http://www.artedossier.it)"

It was a painting like this that provided the link between the painter's purely Neo-Impressionist period and his later Populist period.\n\nIn the centre of the painting the cathedral rises up, radiant in a range of warm tones, primarily oranges, pinks and reds, with bluish shadows made up of fine, juxtaposed brush strokes. The embankment and the bridge, plunged into shadow, are painted using broader brushstrokes, with sky blue, turquoise blue and purplish pink as the dominant tones.\n\nLuce observes the passers-by: well-dressed bourgeois, servants carrying fruit and vegetables, a grandmother holding a child by the hand, and a baker's boy carrying his basket on his head. We can also see the stalls of the bouquinistes, a carriage with its blinds down, an omnibus, a trolley pulled by a man in shirtsleeves and waistcoat... the everyday life of the city. And towering over all this busy and ephemeral human activity stands the cathedral, a symbol of eternity.\n\nThe anecdotal aspect of this series by Luce is in stark contrast with the one Monet produced in 1892 and 1893, of Rouen cathedral, the cliff of stone, which is devoid of any human presence, and given up to the \"drama of the light\". Rather, we are reminded of the tradition of picturesque urban scenes represented by artists like Jean B\u00e9raud and Giuseppe De Nittis. But above all, it is the influence of his friend Camille Pissarro and his last series of views with their plunging perspectives over Paris that is evident in this work by Luce."

        "description": "The city of Los Angeles plays a significant role in the art of Edward Ruscha, and in turn, Ruscha is among the most prominent representatives of the city\u2019s art scene. One of his most intriguing paintings is [i]Los Angeles County Museum on Fire[/i] (1965-1968), in which the artist chose to depict then newly built art museum set ablaze. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LAMCA), is a three building complex designed by architect William Pereira. Shortly after the building opened to the public in 1965, Ruscha began painting [i]Los Angeles County Museum on Fire[/i]. When initially exhibited in 1968 at the [i]Irving Blum Gallery[/i] in Los Angeles, Rusha announced via telegram that the fire marshal would be on hand to see \u201c[i]the most controversial painting to be shown in Los Angeles in our time[/i]\u201d. In this spirit, the painting was placed behind a velvet rope, as if to hold back angry crowds.\n\nRuscha depicted the new LACMA building in precise detail. In order to capture this aerial point of view of the museum building he used preparatory photographs taken from a helicopter. Throughout the years, the painting provoked different interpretations among art critics and historians. Most often, scholars have interpreted the painting as a critique of cultural and art institutions: while the new building was a way of enhance the legitimacy of the Los Angeles art community, Ruscha, as one of its leading representatives expressed a growing sense of alienation from the city\u2019s art scene and its institutions. Others, however, understood the painting as a playful statement on the rising status of Los Angles art - the city\u2019s art scene is so in demand that it is \u2018on fire\u2019.  Another interpretation suggested [i]Los Angeles County Museum on Fire[/i] was an allusion to the Watts riots that happened in Los Angeles in the summer of 1965. The riots, a result of racial tensions between the local community and the authorities, led to six days of conflict that resulted in 34 deaths and extensive property damage. The aerial photographs Ruscha used while painting [i]Los Angeles County Museum on Fire[/i] were the same mode of surveillance the Los Angeles Police Department applied when the city was engulfed in flames during the Watts riots. It is possible that the painting melded the two different realities happening in Los Angeles at the time.\n\nRuscha generally rejected all of these interpretations arguing that he was mainly interested in depicting the ambiguity between serene and chaotic elements. He painted an elegant composition and a clean architectural structure, while a fire bursts from the back section of the complex. This kind of detachment amplifies a sense of uneasiness, and the artist builds tension through this contrast. In several interviews, Ruscha stated that the painting, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/richard-eurich/withdrawal-from-dunkirk-june-1940-1940][i]Withdrawal of Dunkrik[/i][/url] (1940) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/richard-eurich]Richard Eurich[/url] served as the inspiration for [i]Los Angeles County Museum on Fire[/i]. Even though Ruscha chose to focus on the formal elements of the painting, the context, the timing and the choice of subject still suggest a strong connection to the social and cultural development of Los Angeles."

        "description": "This impressive work by the Milanese painter Bernardino Luini provides an important key in understanding the artist's early artistic career.  The attribution to Luini, which had previously been accepted by all scholars but one, is indisputable in light of the presence of his signature and date; something which had been previously ignored in all the literature as the signature only recently emerged after cleaning.  The discovery of the artist's signature is extremely important in shedding light on Luini's early artistic development, particularly in the light of the paucity of documentary evidence covering this period.  Until now scholars had found it extremely difficult to establish an early chronology for Luini\u2019s oeuvre and indeed for anything prior to his first securely datable commission, the frescoes of 1512 in the Abbey of Chiaravalle, near Milan.  The authorship of the Saint Sebastian is closely linked to that of a panel showing The Madonna and Child with Saints Augustine, Margaret and two music-making angels in the Mus\u00e9e Jacquemart-Andr\u00e9, Paris, and it thus provides an important stepping stone between the Paris picture and later works given to Luini.1  The Paris panel is signed and dated Bernardino Mediolanensis Faciebat MDVII (1507); its form of signature denoting the emphasis the artist has placed on his town of origin (\u2018Mediolanensis\u2019 meaning Milanese).  It has been plausibly argued that he would only have done so if executing the panel away from Milan, and Luini\u2019s possible absence from the city during the first decade of the 16th century seems corroborated by the few documents that have come to light.  Luini\u2019s uncle Pietro de Scapis is recorded as acting on his nephew\u2019s behalf in two documents of 1504 and 1507, suggesting that Luini may indeed have been absent from Milan in these years.2  The panel\u2019s early provenance from the Manfrin collection in Venice has led scholars to presume Luini visited that city and, at first glance, the painting in the Mus\u00e9e Jacquemart-Andr\u00e9 does indeed appear extremely Venetic.  The \u2018sacra conversazione\u2019 format and figure-types are reminiscent of Giovanni Bellini and, in particular, of Cima da Conegliano, but the painting\u2019s Lombard roots are equally in evidence: as Giulio Bora has observed, the influence of Andrea Solario and Ambrogio Bergognone is apparent in the figures of the angels and in the execution of details such as their hair.3  There is no doubt that artists active during the first quarter of the 16th century in Lombardy and the Veneto were closely linked: Bartolomeo Veneto, Marco Marziale and Gian Francesco Caroto all worked in both regions, and thus the idea that Luini may have travelled there is by no means implausible.\n\nAt first glance the Saint Sebastian also appears to be rooted in the Venetian tradition, particularly with its use of a polychromed architectural setting, but the influence of the Lombard High Renaissance painters is also marked and, as Franco Moro has pointed out, that of Bramantino in particular. The manner in which the light plays over the saint\u2019s torso, although normally associated with Venetian painting, is (as Bayer points out) \u2018a fundamental descriptive tool... also an important element of the Lombard tradition, beginning with Vincenzo Foppa and then reinforced and elaborated by Leonardo\u2019s example\u2019.4\n\nThe Saint Sebastian has been correctly associated, first by Anna Ottino Della Chiesa and later by Bernard Berenson, with three other panels of similar dimensions representing Saint Peter, Saint Martha and A Bishop Saint in the Borromeo collection on the Isola Bella (Novara).5  It has been convincingly argued that all three panels once formed part of a single polyptych: indeed they each represent a saint, shown from a low viewpoint and standing full-length before a niche, holding his or her attribute.  Sebastian\u2019s pose echoes that of Peter; their feet are in exactly the same position (one seen frontally and the other in profile) and their bodies are placed just left of centre, pointing right, thus indicating that they must have originally stood to the left of the altarpiece\u2019s main axis.  Martha, on the other hand, stands just right of centre and her body points slightly to the left, thus indicating that her original position was most likely on the other side.  All three saints have points in common with the figures in Luini's Lamentation in the Sz\u00e9pm\u00fcv\u00e9szeti M\u00fazeum, Budapest, and the clothed figures of Peter and Martha are generically similar to those gathered around the Dead Christ in Luini's later Lamentation, painted for the church of San Giorgio, Milan, in 1516.  The fact that the Saint Sebastian is the only signed and dated panel from the group is important, not only in securing 1510 as the date of execution for the entire polyptych but also for confirming beyond any doubt the three panels\u2019 authorship.  It was not until the second decade of the 16th century that Luini\u2019s style developed recognisably into his own, somewhat formulaic on the one hand but deeply influenced by Raphael and Leonardo on the other. Indeed one should assume that Luini\u2019s style entered into its more \u2018Leonardesque\u2019 phase only after Leonardo\u2019s second Milanese sojourn, which took place from 1508 to 1513."

No less agitated is what happens along the rims of the fresco, the area of terrestrial life. In spite of the number of figures, the daring abridgments and the expansive gesture, the picture space appears well organized and clearly structured."

        "description": "This iconic painting shows Dr. Tulp providing an anatomy lesson, as the forceps in his right hand lift a tendon from the partially dissected arm of a man who had been executed for armed robbery earlier that morning. Tulp looks toward the seven men gathered around the corpse as his left hand gestures to explain an anatomical point. The men, their white collars and fine clothes indicating their wealth, look in various directions. The three closest to the center lean forward as if watching Tulp's hands, while the two in the back look out toward the viewer. The two on the far left, depicted in profile, face toward Tulp but seem to be looking beyond him, outside the picture frame. A sense of dynamic movement and psychological complexity results, as no one returns Tulp's gaze or looks directly at the pale corpse. The umbra mortis, or shadow of death, fills the center of the canvas. The man's body, his genitals covered with a piece of white linen, evokes the iconography of Christ's death, though here, the body is forgotten, at the same time his dissected arm grimly conveys death's reality.\n\nIn this work, Rembrandt innovatively transformed group portraiture by dramatically focusing on the event in mid-action, rather than merely presenting a posed scene. As a result the work becomes a mise-en-scene, a kind of graphic documentary, and a masterful portrait.\n\nThe Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons commissioned the group portrait, Rembrandt's first important one in the city. The men attended the Guild's annual public dissection in 1632 at which Dr. Tulp, the City Anatomist, presided. In 17th century Holland, anatomical lessons were noted social events, accompanied by music, conversation, and food and wine, taking place in theater lecture rooms, and attended by those who could afford the entrance fee. The well-dressed appearance of these men, their white collars and fine gowns, testify to their social importance, and yet, they are presented as if both sensationalized and distracted, their humanity overshadowing their status.\n\nManet painted a copy of this painting in 1856 after studying it on a trip to the Netherlands, and the American realist Thomas Eakins was also influenced by it in painting his The Gross Clinic (1875). The executed man Kindt has also taken on a kind of later cultural life, referred to in W. G. Sebald's The Rings of Saturn (1999) and in Nina Siegal's The Anatomy Lesson (2014), which tells his story."

This painting was also notable because it was generally difficult to paint Muslim women, who were covered head to toe, but Delacroix was secretly able to sketch some during his travels to Morocco in 1832. It was critically acclaimed when it was presented to the Salon, and King Louis Philippe bought the painting, presenting it to the Museum of Luxembourg.

It was created around 1910, at the height of the activities of the Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung M\u00fcnchen (NKVM), which was composed by her, Alexej von Jawlensky, Wassily Kandinsky, Gabriele M\u00fcnter and others had been founded the year before and can be described as the forerunner of the Blue Rider.\n\n\"Into the Night\" was shown in September 1910 at the 2nd NVKM exhibition in the Thannhauser Gallery in Munich. Werefkin was represented here with five other paintings, \"Into the Night\" was shown in the accompanying catalog as one of the few of the 115 works in the exhibition. This underscores the importance attached to the image not only by the artist but by the group as a whole.\nThe depiction of the painting, which is demanding in terms of format alone - it is one of Werefkin's greatest works - leads to the center of her artistic statement: It is a nocturnal scene after a stage performance in an open street, in the front you can see the deserted, simple benches for the Viewers. In the left corner there is a makeshift cloth for the stage, in front of it are two actors in their costumes. The king in the red cloak seems to harass the figure in front of him in unspoken conflict. The stage situation, the three mute female figures in the doorways, which, as the artist often addresses, seem to indicate a strained gender relationship, and the expressive colors are central elements of Werefkin's tempera paintings, which deal with the subject of human existence and its being at the mercy of invisible forces inner and outer nature, be it psychological sensitivities or fateful powers.\n\n[url href=https://www.lenbachhaus.de/en/discover/collection-online/detail/in-die-nacht-hinein-30036494]Lenbachhaus[/url]"

The fact that these works were created within a few years of each other but a certain time after the highly complex image by the artist from Nuremburg raises the question of whether there was an external cause. This may be related to Luther's view on Melancholy and its negative consequences. Based on these Cranach designed his antithesis/counter-images to D\u00fcrer's new, now positively tainted interpretation of the melancholic disposition."

Its major movement is the journey taken by an Italian Femme Fetale that begins on a New York City subway platform awaiting her metaphorical \u201ctrain\u201d and her journey continues -- painting by painting -- like a roller coaster ride through her mind.  \r\n \r\nIn the end, the littered hotel room scene from Work 2 is mirrored with an empty hotel room scene in Work 8. The final scene (Work 9) brings the viewer full circle to the same Femme fetale on the subway platform in Work 1, to make us wonder, \u201cWas this all just a dream or a foreshadowing of events to come?\u201d On some level \u2013 visually and psychologically - every scene shimmers with unreality from one painting to the next like pieces to a puzzle or clues to a crime, only Bell\u2019s work compels the viewer to participate in the ambiguity of the drama.\r\n\r\n"

This scene is the only one on the shrine that hints at the relics contained inside. The Virgin Mary and the Christ Child sit enthroned beneath an arcade; from the left, the three Magi approach with their gifts. The oldest of the three is in the process of kneeling down in adoration. The style of this relief differs from those depicting the prophets on the sides of the shrine, which date from around 1190 and can be attributed to the goldsmith Nicholas of Verdun. It is likely that the Adoration of the Magi was made in a different workshop."

The portrayed woman is one of his two daughters from his marriage with Kitty Garman (a daughter of a sculptor [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-epstein]Jacob Epstein[/url]).\n\nWhat is quite innovative in Freud\u2019s approach to the depicted subject, is the perspective. The artist represents a lying body completely turned away from us, so we cannot see the facial expression - but still, the painting is quite expressive. The body is curled up in the fetal position, which can be interpreted as a reaction to a physical or psychological trauma. Representing his sleeping daughter like this, Freud may be suggesting that he is a helpless observer of her mental and emotional pain. He also is putting the viewer into a position of a voyeur who intrudes a woman\u2019s personal space and gets the insight of how she feels. Besides, this painting could be read in a feminist key - a woman is expressing her trauma only when she is sleeping, only when she is unaware that others are watching.\n\nIn his paintings, Freud demonstrates a tangibility of humans - be it their emotional pain and struggle, or be it naturalism in depicting of their bodies. This tangibility of Annabel is shown in a brute physicality of her feet. The artist emphasizes small details, like motion of muscles and texture of the skin. He de-idealizes the human body, breaking with the tradition of representing a female figure as a beautiful and flawless object,  and insists on the corporeality of all bodies. This de-idealization reminds us of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url]\u2019s realism, which can be seen in his works such as [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/madonna-of-loreto]Madonna of Loreto[/url][/i], [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/entombment]Entombment of Christ[/url][/i] or [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/crucifixion-of-saint-peter-1601]Crucifixion of Saint Peter[/url][/i].

His central figure, a goddess-like woman embodying an owl of wisdom, is the icon nurture and virtue, radiant against the bleak background of storm clouds and darkness. Through her flows a stream of fertility and rebirth in the form of labia-like fruits, proffered from the toil of the rural worker. \r\n\r\nIn the foreground, Jorg Immendorff depicts the present as an arid and cracked soil. His egg - reminiscent of the globe - offers hope for the future, weighting down a manuscript stating: \u2018Society with a lack: industry, pride, honesty, respect before Art.\u2019"

According to art historian Robert Hughes, the tower draws inspiration from the Mole Antonelliana, a landmark tower in the city of Turin, Italy. During his travels as an emerging artist, De Chirico traveled to Turin, and was inspired by its metaphysical presence, especially the architecture of its piazzas and archways. It was also a city he connected with Nietzsche, who occasionally summered in Turin, and of whose philosophy De Chirico was a follower. In modern media, this image has influenced the painting for the box cover of the video game Ico, which draws artistic inspiration from the many vast and lonely expanses apparent in De Chirico\u2019s works."

Though the title of this painting is Adam et Eve (Adam and Eve), it was inspired by Orestes and Electra, a classical Greek sculpture in the Museum of Naples, which portrays Electra and her brother considering revenge on their mother and stepfather for the murder of their father, Agamemnon. Classical subjects such as this were popular in the interwar period, yet most artists attempted to give new life to Classicism by adapting it to modern times. Picabia refuses this temptation, instead leaving the statue enigmatically layered with a smiling face and leaving us with a mystery. This clash of imagery from apparently different sources would be a major inspiration for later artists such as Sigmar Polke. "

        "description": "One of the most celebrated British paintings is the portrait [i]The Blue Boy[/i] (c. 1770) by Thomas Gainsborough. The painting shows a boy dressed in a 17th-century costume, an homage to the Flemish master [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Anthony van Dyck[/url]. The dress and gestures in [i]The Blue Boy[/i] echo van Dyck\u2019s portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/charles-ii-as-child-1637][i]Charles II as a child[/i][/url] (1637), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/the-five-eldest-children-of-charles-i-1637][i]The Children of King Charles I of England[/i][/url] (1637) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/portrait-of-charles-ii-when-prince-of-wales][i]Charles II as Prince of Wales, in Armor[/i][/url] (c. 1637-1638). These types of portraits were usually not commissions, instead, they served as intellectual exercises that allowed portrait painters to experiment, to show off their painterly skills and mastery. Gainsborough demonstrates his artistry in his treatment of the brooding landscape in the background, and the satin fabric costume in which he experiments with the play of light and shadow on the garment.\n\nIt has been said that Gainsborough painted [i]The Blue Boy[/i] because of his rivalry with fellow portrait painter, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joshua-reynolds]Sir Joshua Reynolds[/url]. In his writings, Reynolds stated that cool colors should not dominate the foreground, rather they should be used in small amounts to set off the warm colors in the painting. However, this story was likely invented to play up the rivalry between the painters: [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was exhibited in 1770, and Reynolds made this remark in 1778. Still, it is worth noting that the two painters held opposed artistic beliefs: while Reynolds was very stern and advocated for the study of old masters, Gainsborough was more spontaneous and modern in his approach. \n\nBecause he was the owner of the painting, it was widely believed that the sitter in the painting was Jonathan Buttall, the son of a wealthy hardware merchant. However, this identification was never confirmed and recently art historian Susan Sloman suggested the sitter could be Gainsborough Dupont, the artist\u2019s nephew. Dupont lived with Gainsborough\u2019s family in Bath and London and was the painter\u2019s one and only resident apprentice and assistant. Gainsborough painted his nephew\u2019s portrait in a similar costume on two other occasions: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/dupont][i]Gainsborough Dupont[/i][/url] (1770-1772) in the Tate collection and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/gainsborough-dupont-1773][i]Gainsborough Dupont[/i][/url] (1773) in the Rothschild collection. The two portraits of Dupont demonstrate a physical resemblance to the sitter in [i]The Blue Boy[/i]. In the Rothschild portrait, Dupont even wears a blue frock like the one worn by [i]The Blue Boy[/i]. Furthermore, x-rays of the painting show that originally Gainsborough painted a dog next to the boy. The dog, an English water spaniel was likely Tristram, one of the Gainsborough\u2019s family pets, making it more likely that the artist was painting a family member.\n\nThe painting belonged to Jonathan Buttall until he filed for bankruptcy in 1796. From that point, it changed several owners: initially it was bought by politician John Nesbitt, later, in 1802, by painter John Hoppner, and in 1809, it entered the collection of Earl Grosvenor. During this period, [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was featured in multiple exhibitions: it became beloved by the public and was widely reproduced in print. In 1921, the iconic painting was sold to American railroad magnate Henry Edward Huntington for \u00a3182,200 \u2013 a record price at the time. The sale caused public outcry so before it was shipped to California, it was briefly displayed at The National Gallery. [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was seen by 90,000 people, and The National Gallery director Charles Holmes even made an emotional gesture by scrawling the words \u201cAu Revoir, C.H\u201d on the back of the canvas. Today, the painting is in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California."

One of what is believed to be only five versions (green, blue, purple, yellow and here, red), made on this monumental scale, this vast but simple, even in some ways minimalist, image of the artist's famous but time-worn face peering tentatively out from under the wild hair of his instantly-recognizable 'fright-wig' is one of the great self-portrait images of the Twentieth Century. A comparatively rare self-exposure, the painting is a typically seamless fusion of painting and photography within one instantly unforgettable image. A vast, and somewhat morbid, icon of an icon, it is also, like so many artists' late self-portraits throughout history, a timeless portrait of a visibly aging master confronting the inevitability of his own imminent disappearance from the light of existence, in death. \r\n\r\nWarhol\u2019s last series of self-portraits are among the most iconic, moving and ultimately profound works of his entire career. Among the very last paintings he executed before he did indeed suffer a premature and unexpected death - following complications that arose after a routine operation on his gall bladder in February 1987 - this series of self-portraits have consequently gained a prescience and an uncanny sense of timeliness that has done much to reinforce the legend of Warhol as a modern-day seer. The 'somewhat unearthly... and terrifying oracle' as Calvin Tomkins once described him, who 'made visible what was happening in some part to us all', seems here, in these works, to be foreseeing intimations of his own death.

The project was abandoned, but Heade retained his interest in hummingbirds and continued to paint them in combination with orchids and jungle backgrounds through the 1870s. The NGA describes the work: \"Lichen covers dead branches; moss drips from trees; and, a blue-gray mist veils the distant jungle. An opulent pink orchid with light-green stems and pods dominates the left foreground.\" On the right, two green-and-pink Brazilian Amethysts hover about a nest while a red-tailed Sappho Comet perches nearby."

        "description": "II. THE HIGH PRIESTESS\n\nThis card is referred to the letter Gimel, which means a Camel. (The symbolism of the Camel is explained later.)\n\nThe card refers to the Moon. The Moon (being the general feminine symbol, the symbol of the second order corresponding to the Sun as the Yoni does to the Lingam) is universal, and goes from the highest to the lowest. It is a symbol which will recur frequently in these hieroglyphs. But in the earlier Trumps the concern is with Nature above the Abyss; the High Priestess is the first card which connects the Supernal Triad with the Hexad; and her path, as shown in the diagram, makes a direct connection between the Father in his highest aspect, and the Son in his most perfect manifestation. This path is in exact balance in the middle pillar. There is here, therefore, the purest and most exalted conception of the Moon. (At the other end of the scale is Atu xviii, q.v.)\n\nThe card represents the most spiritual form of Isis the Eternal Virgin; the Artemis of the Greeks. She is clothed only in the luminous veil of light. It is important for high initiation to regard Light not as the perfect manifestation of the Eternal Spirit, but rather as the veil which hides that Spirit It does so all the more effectively because of its incomparably dazzling brilliance.\n\n[The tradition of the best schools of Hindu mysticism has a precise parallelism. The final obstacle to full Enlightenment is exactly this Vision of Formless Effulgence].\n\nThus she is light and the body of light. She is the truth behind the veil of light. She is the soul of light. Upon her knees is the bow of Artemis, which is also a musical instrument, for she is huntress, and hunts by enchantment. \n\nNow, regard this idea as from behind the Veil of Light, the third Veil of the original Nothing. This light is the menstruum of manifestation, the goddess Nuith, the possibility of Form. This first and most spiritual manifestation of the feminine takes to itself a masculine correlative, by formulating in itself any geometrical point from which to contemplate possibility. This virginal goddess is then potentially the goddess of fertility. She is the idea behind all form; as soon as the influence of the triad descends below the Abyss, there is the completion of concrete idea.\n\nThe following chapter of the Book of Lies (falsely so-called), may assist the student to understand this doctrine by dint of meditation:\n\nDUST DEVILS \nIn the Wind of the mind arises the turbulence called I. \nIt breaks; down shower the barren thoughts. \nAll life is choked. \nThis desert is the Abyss wherein is the Universe. \nThe Stars are but thistles in that waste. \nYet this desert is but one spot accurs\u00e9d in a world of bliss. Now and again Travellers cross the desert; they come from the Great Sea, and to the Great Sea they go. \nAnd as they go they spill water; one day they will irrigate the desert, till it flower. \nSee! Five footprints of a Camel! V.V.V.V.V. \n(For the classical description of the Abyss, the student should consult Liber 418, The Vision and the Voice, especially the Tenth Aethyr The Equinox, Vol. I, No.5, Supplement.)\n\nAt the bottom of the card, accordingly, are shown nascent forms, whorls, crystals, seeds, pods, symbolising the beginnings of life. In the midst is the Camel which is mentioned in the chapter quoted above. In this card is the one link between the archetypal and formative worlds.\n\nThus far concerning this path, considered as issuing downwards from the Crown; but to the aspirant, that is, to the adept who is already in Tiphareth, to him who has attained to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, this is the path which leads upwards; and this card, in one system entitled the Priestess of the Silver Star, is symbolic of the thought (or rather of the intelligible radiance) of that Angel. It is, in short, a symbol of the highest Initiation. Now it is a condition of Initiation that its keys are to be communicated by those who possess them to all true aspirants. This card is thus very peculiarly a glyph of the work of the A.\u2019.A.\u2019.\n\nSome idea of the formula is given in this other chapter of the Book of Lies:\n\nTHE OYSTER \nThe Brothers of A.\u2019.A.\u2019. are one with the Mother of the Child. \nThe Many is as adorable to the One as the One is to the Many. This is the Love of These; creation-parturition is the Bliss of the One; coition-dissolution is the Bliss of the Many. \nThe All, thus interwoven of These, is Bliss. \nNaught is beyond Bliss. \nThe Man delights in uniting with the Woman; the Woman in parting from the Child. \nThe Brothers of A.\u2019.A.\u2019. are Women; the Aspirants to A.\u2019.A.\u2019. are Men.\n\nIt is important to reflect that this card is wholly feminine, wholly virginal, for it represents the influence and the means of manifestation (or, from below, of attainment) in itself. It represents possibility in its second stage without any beginning of consummation.\n\nIt is especially to be observed that the three consecutive letters, Gimel, Daleth, He\u2019 (Atu II, III, XVII) show the Feminine Symbol (Yin) in three forms composing a Triune Goddess. This Trinity is immediately followed by the three corresponding and complementary Fathers, Vau, Tzaddi, Yod (Atu IV, V, IX). The Trumps 0 and I are hermaphrodite. The remaining fourteen Trumps represent these Primordial Quintessences of Being in conjunction, function, or manifestation."

In March 1962 Agar wrote about the first time she met him (Chamot, Farr and Butlin, p.6). It had been in either 1938 or 1939, when he had arrived with the writer and poet David Gascoyne (b.1916), halfway through a dinner party Agar was hosting.\r\n\r\n\"Dylan (then about 25 I believe) sat on the floor and began reciting very lively limericks. Suddenly all the lights went out - a fuse - and when they had come on again the whole mood of our rather dull party had changed. It had come alive with the advent of the two poets. This is when I made a sketch of Dylan, from which, after much meditation and many years had passed, I painted (very quickly) the head now in the Brook Street Gallery\" (Agar quoted in Chamot, Farr and Butlin, pp.6-7).\r\n\r\nAgar developed this style of painting from her experiments with automatism, the technique of painting spontaneously in an attempt to tap into the unconscious. Ultimately, she found 'the process of automatic artistic creation' rather unsatisfactory. She explained, 'I am suspicious about the whole idea of working from dreams. I find that daytime dreams can be inspiring, but not night-time ones - they are too confusing. My own method is to put myself in a state of receptivity during the day' (Agar quoted in Simpson, Gascoyne and Lambirth, p.26). She also found the technique associated with automatism, which involved dribbling oil paint and lacquer onto the canvas from a height, left too much to chance effects. She preferred to guide the paint and achieve a calligraphic style. (Chloe Johnson)"

The greatest license Sully took in portraying Victoria as a lovely young woman was to express her sensuality. This comes across in the oil study, in which he described her neck and shoulders in the succulent, painterly style that characterizes his finest work."

Though many believe they were painted for money (they were sold through an agent in Algiers), his close friends have maintained that Picabia always painted what he wanted and that they cannot be dismissed as anomalies in his career. Curators after the war often did put them aside in favor of celebrating Picabia's Dada years, yet since the 1980s these pictures have been an important influence on artists ranging from David Salle to John Currin, who have been fascinated by their embrace of kitsch."

Like many former slaves he had fought for the British in the American Revolutionary War. It was during this period that he lost his leg.\r\nWaters was a popular and well-known figure, playing his fiddle and entertaining children outside London\u2019s West End theatres. He was elected \u2018King of the Beggars\u2019 just before his death in 1823. He was one of several African personalities featured in the publication Life in London (1821).  In this painting, Waters is portrayed as dignified and proud. Although in public he often acted the clown, this painting suggests a more serious and powerful side to him."

It was believed to have been purchased and connected to a rare \"celebration\" of his art, even though it's not connected to this 1932 example, the other that follow it do - such as when the Austrian Post published in 1932, a six-value series of stamps about Austrian painters, including the portrait of Egger-Lienz.  \n\nSome years later, three stamps were issued of Egger-Lienz work '100 years K\u00fcnstlerhaus, 1961; Christmas, 1969, European Family Congress, 1978, - and it is thought/assumed by the family that version listed here - is from the Christmas 1969 period.  \n\nA one-schilling coin of the post-war period, designed by Michael Powolny, showed the figure of the devil from Egger-Lienz' \u2018painting. 'S\u00e4mann and Teufel'.\n\nThe gravure itself is in very good condition (see photos), adhered to the velum outer cover from a German hardback book which is 4mm thick card - 24cm x 18.3cm; - the image itself is 19.3cm x 14cm.  The backing board the gravure is attached to, there's slight damage (see photo) on the upper right-hand side, and occurred when it was removed from its original frame, that is not included in this listing. \n\nIt was framed, though as I am offering FREE postage, the frame is not included in the sale, (if you really wanted it, - then contact us so we can arrange a payment of \u00a310 for the frame + Postage Costs. We could send you photos so you can see the condition of the frame before you buy).\n\nThough, this would look great if bordered, mounted, and hung in a contemporary wooden frame that contrasts the rich nutty-wooden-autumn-like colours, - come summers-morning/evening glows that flow from this striking humbling image.   \n\nIn 1930, the Egger-Lienz-Gasse was named after the painter in Vienna Meidling The Egger-Lienz-Platz is located in Lienz In 1951, a memorial placard was added to the former dwelling-house of the artist in Veithgasse 3 in Vienna A monument is located in L\u00e4ngenfeld in Tyrol, Where he spent his summer stays in the Gries-Quirein district of Grisons, the Egger-Lienz-Strasse recalls the artist \n\nAmong the national socialists, Egger-Lienz was esteemed especially by Alfred Rosenberg, but this did not lead to any exhibition of Egger-Lienz\u2019s works before the Anschluss of Austria in 1938. The ever-valued appreciation of Adolf Hitler\u2019s for Egger-Lienz is an unstable political myth. The image of man and woman, given to him by the Gaukulturleitung K\u00e4rnten, on the occasion of the 50th birthday, the painting was immediately given to the K\u00e4rntner Landesgalerie, more in 1943, the still existing Egger-Lienz-Museum was opened in the Lienzer Schloss Bruck. The cultural policy of the National Socialists was the works of the early and the middle of his war women was exhibited in 1940, as in the 1940/41 gallery in Welz in Vienna \u2013 but in a Separee \u2013 the picture finale. Other pictures such as 'The Nameless' in 1914, were reinterpreted in the national socialist sense.\n\nThis official appreciation by the national socialists has left the reception of Egger-Lienz permanently disabled in the Second Republic Between 1945 and 1996, only four individual exhibitions were held. In 1968 Egger\u2019s birthday was ignored even in Tyrol, only in 1976 and again in 1996 were the round deathdays Exhibitions in the Tiroler Landesmuseum Ferdinandeum. According to his biographer, Wilfried Kirschl, in the last few years the receptionist Eggers defined a departure from the emphasis of the popular, the typical to the designer of the war experience and the late thought images. Robert Holzbauer sees the classification Egger-Lienz \u2018 As a representative of classical modernism.\n\nThe older reproductions such as lithographs and gravure images can sell for \u00a3100s to \u00a31000's\nSource: https://www.invaluable.com/artist/egger-lienz-albin-wfv538j5ox/sold-at-auction-prices/\n\nIn the art market, the large number of replicas of the individual paintings are fetching high prices. The market is also essentially limited to this Austrian artists work. The highest price achieved for a picture of Egger-Lienz is 760,000 euros, which took place on 30 May 2006 at an auction In the Viennese Dorotheum for a version of the Totentanz 1809 of 1921. The highest international price was around 208,000 euro for a version of the Bergm\u00e4her of 1907, which were achieved 2002 at Sotheby\u2019s in London - source: https://www.hisour.com/albin-egger-lienz-14190/\n \nHere's a great blog that covers a lot of his work titled 'Albin Egger-Lienz: Work and War, 1904-1926' https://eclecticlight.co/2018/05/20/albin-egger-lienz-work-and-war-1904-1926/ \n\nAlbin Egger-Lienz (1868\u20131926), one of the most important pioneers of Austrian Expressionism, to whom the Belvedere will devote an exhibition in spring 2014. The artist\u2019s war paintings are impressive memorials warning against the horrors of fighting and violence.\n\nIn 1906, the purchasing commission of the Modern Gallery, today\u2019s Belvedere, commissioned the artist to create a work. In time for the diamond jubilee of Emperor Francis Joseph I and shortly before the 100th anniversary of the Tyrolean Wars of Liberation, Egger-Lienz delivered the painting Danse Macabre of 1809, the earliest surviving version of a motif with which he frequently dealt between 1906 and 1921. When the painting was first presented publicly on the occasion of the jubilee celebrations, its non-festive atmosphere was felt to be a provocation; in 1914, it was interpreted as foreboding of World War I, whereas the National Socialists tried to abuse the work in order to justify the idea of dying a hero\u2019s death.\n\nStarting out from the painting Danse Macabre of 1809 and presenting numerous further works by the artist, the exhibition Danse Macabre: Egger-Lienz and the War traces Egger-Lienz\u2019s artistic evolution and elucidates various references and lines of interpretation.print (with copyright fees to be paid to Egger-Lienz estate for any reproductions made) published from at least the 1960s era.\n\nHe was born in D\u00f6lsach-Stribach near Lienz, in what was the county of Tyrol. As an artist, he had a special preference for the rustic genre and historical paintings; under the influence of Ferdinand Hodler, Egger-Lienz abstracted his formal language into monumental expressiveness.\n\nHe trained first under his father (a church painter), later he studied at the Academy in Munich where he was influenced by Franz Defregger and French painter Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet. In 1899 he moved to Vienna. During 1911 and 1912 he was a professor at the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School in Weimar and he served as war painter during World War I. In 1918, he turned down a professorship at the Vienna Academy and settled in South Tyrol. Egger-Lienz died on 4 November 1926 in St. Justina-Rentsch (it), Bolzano, Italy.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albin_Egger-Lienz"

The work was completed shortly after Nash visited the International Surrealist Exhibition of 1938 and it is inspired by the Surrealists' fascination with Freud as well as by their principle theories surrounding the power of dreams. At the time, Nash had also recently met and become a good friend of the Surrealist artist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eileen-agar]Eileen Agar[/url] who like Nash spent a great deal of time walking the coast and finding inspiration there. Along with connections to Agar, the dominant cloud filled sky and central objects placed in a mystical landscape bear strong resemblance to the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rene-magritte]Ren\u00e9 Magritte[/url]. Magritte was a long-standing influence for Nash and one that he returned to towards the end of his career when painting his \"aerial flower\" series.\n\nThe painting shows a hawk contemplating itself in a mirror, in which there is also a landscape and several spheres. The action is set within another landscape - the Dorset coast - though it is contained between screens. The mixture of the unusual activity at the center of the painting combined with the recognizable surroundings outside it results in an overall impression that is both unsettling and intriguing. This combination of familiar and unexpected has much in common with the nature of dreams. Nash later explained the symbolism of each of the elements in the painting: the hawk represents the material world and the spheres, the soul.\n\nThe artist and historian Roland Penrose praised [i]Landscape from a dream[/i], drawing a similarity between the bird looking at itself in the mirror and the viewer contemplating the painting. He wrote that just as the bird \"watches itself in a glass, waiting for the image to move so as to know which is really alive, itself or the image\", Nash's paintings \"[assert] their independent life\". This idea of movement becomes more complex in view of the fact that Nash painted the bird from an Egyptian carving. Thus the \"real\" hawk is immobile and the flying hawk in the mirror is an illusion. The carving from which the hawk was painted now adorns the artist's grave.\n\n[url href=https://www.theartstory.org/artist/nash-paul/artworks/][b]by TheArtStory[/b][/url]"

        "description": "The Cellist is one of Bradley's early works, and like other known early paintings by this artist, this one is small in scale and depicts a full-length figure. Nothing is known about the sitter, but he seems to be a man of means as well as a musician, as suggested by the elegant setting with a stylish pianoforte and cello that are prominent in the composition. The two objects on the Sheraton-style bench--a pink cloth kerchief and a pitch pipe or resin applicator for use on the strings of a bow\u2014also suggest that he is a practicing musician. The sheet music\u2014a hymn published in London about 1820\u2014is legible enough to be identified and played, showing the artist\u2019s careful attention to detail. Bradley rendered the man\u2019s striking features\u2014piercing blue eyes, wavy hair, and lean face\u2014with faithfulness and verve. Painted with crisp lines and carefully noted details, the figure seems alive as he gazes directly at us.\r\n\r\nThe figure's awkward proportions are typical of self taught painters such as we assume Bradley to be. An impossibly long right arm rests on a relatively short leg; the tiny feet, clad in black slippers, seem intended to convey the musician's refinement, as does his slender form. Bradley's unusual technique of highlighting the contours of forms to give them greater volume can be seen in the area of the sitter's right knee and arm. Typical of Bradley's portraits\u2014and of portraiture by self-taught artists\u2014are the limited tones\u2014brown, white, and black\u2014enlivened by such broad accents as the rich red curtain and green-figured carpet."

The composition follows the then fashionable patterns of portrait\u00adure, but its strident tone had a provocative effect on the prevailing taste.

The subject matter was likely chosen by Allan, who seems to have considered the original painting one of Kane\u2019s best, and its treatment points to an assumption of the urban audience\u2019s interest in theatrical \u201cexoticism.\u201d\r\n          The subject is the death of the Blackfoot chief at the hands of a Cree warrior, an event Kane imagined, based on hearsay.2  There are no known preparatory drawings, but the brown horse\u2019s headstall and the Cree warrior\u2019s shoulder bag depicted in the image were inspired by items Kane had collected.3  One can imagine Kane in his studio, relying both on reproductions of European paintings\u2014such as The Start of the Race of the Riderless Horses, c. 1820, by Horace Vernet (1789\u20131863)\u2014and on his own collection of Aboriginal artifacts to create this striking painting of Canadian history. \r\n          The chromolithograph is remarkable for the degree to which it corresponds to the original painting in spatial relationships and in detail. It is doubtful, however, that Kane himself was actively involved in the lithographic process. The printers have been identified as Charles Fuller and Hermann Bencke, a Prussian immigrant. Fuller and Bencke\u2019s superb workmanship is evident both in the embossed surface that creates texture and depth and in the extensive number of colours used; as a testament to this workmanship, the chromolithograph has been used as a reliable reference for the conservation of the original painting."

Around her neck and spilling down her front is the collar of a cape made of ermine stomachs or lynx furs. While the overall image may seem subdued and unflashy, this monochromatic garment is an indication of royalty; the infanta is actually displaying her noble heritage, wealth and prestige. Catalina Micaela's pale hand, with its rings and gold lace cuff, and her necklaces peeping through the gauzy fabric around her head, are other indications of her great wealth. Similarly, her snow-white skin was seen as a sign of beauty and social rank. It is likely that this was shown to potential suitors in the hope of finding her a husband.\n\nHer direct gaze engages the viewer confidently. When Catalina did marry, she was initially disliked by her husband's courtiers due to her confidence in her own intelligence, which was seen as arrogant. Later, though, she would be praised for her ability to rule. She would die at the age of 30, after the difficult birth of her last child in 1597."

It shows the two possible career paths that were available to her as a young woman - music and painting. However, in the eighteenth century, female singers were often viewed as promiscuous, so Kauffman sought advice from a priest who recommended painting as the more virtuous option.\n\nThe allegorical nature of the painting invites comparisons with Annibale Carraci's Hercules at the Crossroads Between Virtue and Vice, a popular image of the time. Despite criticism that her paintings lacked the virility and manly strength typical of history paintings, Kauffman's decision to create a picture similar to a revered work demonstrates her astute understanding of the art market.\n\nThis self-portrait is unprecedented in its depiction of a female artist making important decisions for herself. Unlike her male contemporaries, who typically portrayed women as weak and subservient, Kauffman's paintings feature strong and empowered female protagonists. Additionally, the popularity of \"choice\" paintings at the time suggests an early interest in exploring individuality and psychology."

The slave trade was still a controversial moral and political issue, and it would not be fully resolved in England until six years later, when Parliament passed the Slavery Abolition Act. With Captive Slave, Simpson dared to take on this contentious subject. As the model for his \u201cslave,\u201d the artist posed Ira Aldridge, the free-born son of a lay preacher in New York, who would go on to have an important career on the London stage. Here Aldridge\u2019s expressive upward gaze conveys a yearning for freedom in an image that both speaks to the historical moment and transcends it."

In 1939, Klee composed twenty-nine works that feature angels, having in earlier years only sporadically depicted them. His angels were not the celestial kind but hybrid creatures beset with human foibles and whims. Klee's angels are \"forgetful, \"still female, \"ugly,\" incomplete,\" or \"poor\"\u2014as the titles he gave these pictures indicate.\n\nSuffering from an incurable illness and sensing himself hovering between life and death, Klee possibly felt a kinship with these outsiders. In this work, he covered a sheet of newspaper with black gouache on which he then drew the outlines of the figure and of the crescent moon with a thick, soft graphite pencil. Then he filled in these forms with a thin white wash. It is the black ground peeking through the white pigment that gives this creature its ghostly shimmer."

The simplicity of the local lifestyle appealed to his interest and gave him a new selection of genre subjects loosely related to his increasing interest in marine scenes. The high level of detail in the work, especially in the figures' hair and the fishing net, evidences Homer's great skill with the difficult medium. The women wear tattered clothes and are focused on their work, a sharp contrast to Homer's earlier compositions of genteel women often engaged in recreational activities.\n\nIt was the style, more than the subject, of Homer's English period that seems to have caught his critics off guard, with one noting in the [i]New York Times[/i], \"They are English in method and style. One needs to read the signed named before believing that the maker of those British watercolors is the same who used to rouse the wrath or admiration of the critics by his quaint conceits, his bald oddities, his lovely transcripts of scenes that only he knew how to depict.\" The historian Nicolas Cikovsky credits the sparsity of style \"in order to achieve the effect of figures against a plain, unlocalized background\" to the influence of Ancient Greek relief sculpture, crediting this newfound sense of compositional space to the metopes of friezes of the fragments of the Parthenon (also known as the \"Elgin Marbles\") Homer would have seen at British Museum in London."

The leeks, oysters and vessels of the painting are arranged in a disparate way to enable us to find our way into the picture. The play between the two worlds of reality and decoration is further intensified by Caulfield's treatment of two of the oysters in their real texture rather than in a graphic manner. Caulfield has always being interested in transforming ordinary things into extraordinary ones, perhaps suggesting that the role of the modern artist is to make people see and examine things in a different light. As he has noted: \"what we call inspiration results from a careful sifting of everyday experience.\"\r\n\r\nCaulfield became interested in still lifes when he realised that they offered him the opportunity to depict objects true to scale; Caulfield has always enjoyed the one to one relationship with his chosen subjects. In the early 1980s he turned further still towards producing images of food and drink, presenting them with equal weight within his paintings.\r\n\r\nThe layering of elements in 'Still life: Autumn fashion' gives the work an extraordinary mystery and intensity. Although Caulfield's art is enjoyable for its economy of means and lush colours, the ambivalence of the space can often mean that spectators feel they are staring into the void. One is confronted with multiple systems that seem to interfere and interact with each other. Unable to define a spatial position in relation to these objects and conventions, the viewer experiences the picture as if from within the compostition.\r\n\r\n'Still life: Autumn fashion' was bought by the Walker in 1979 with the aid of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation's Regional Purchase Scheme and a grant from the Victoria and Albert Museum."

        "description": "[i]Metamorphosis of Narcissus[/i] (1937) by Salvador Dal\u00ed is the artist\u2019s interpretation of the Narcissus myth in Ovid\u2019s [i]Metamorphoses[/i]. According to the myth, Narcissus was a beautiful youth courted by many suitors, who was too proud to love someone in return. After Narcissus rejected the nymph Echo, the goddess of revenge Nemesis decided to punish him for his vanity. One day Narcissus was bending down to drink when he caught a glimpse of his reflection in the clear pool of water. Overcome by strong feelings of love, he tried to embrace his own reflection and when he couldn\u2019t he fell into despair, beating his chest until he died. In the same place, a beautiful flower bloomed, the narcissus.\n \nDal\u00ed\u2019s interpretation of the myth departs from traditional depictions of Narcissus, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/narcissus][i]Narcissus[/i][/url] (c.1599) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Nicolas Poussin[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin/echo-and-narcissus-1630][i]Echo and Narcissus[/i][/url] (1627-1628). Rather than depicting a single moment, Dal\u00ed\u2019s painting highlights the process of transformation. He depicted Narcissus in two modes. On the left, Narcissus is naked in a crouched position, his head is supported by his knee as he looks at his reflection, partially visible in the water. On the right, Narcissus is transformed into an ossified hand holding an egg, out of which a narcissus flower emerges. The motif of the hand holding an egg resembles the assemblage [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/man-ray/main-ray-1936][i]Main Ray[/i][/url] (1935) by fellow Surrealist artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/man-ray]Man Ray[/url], which depicts a hand holding a globe. Dal\u00ed substituted the globe with the egg, which can be linked to the artist\u2019s interest in alchemy. In alchemy, the egg represents an ideal form that is associated with \u2018immaculate conception\u2019. The egg has opposite qualities, its exterior is cold and solid while its inner substance is warm and liquid. In the painting, he alludes to the two qualities of the egg: on the left Narcissus\u2019s head painted in warm yolk tones resembles a chunk of raw material, while on the right it is white, hard and fossilized. The white egg represents purity, and out of this pure form, Narcissus is reborn as a flower.\n \nDal\u00ed began painting [i]Metamorphosis of Narcissus[/i] in the spring of 1937, while he was in Z\u00fcrs, in the Austrian Alps. He also wrote a long poem that accompanied the painting. This was the first painting Dal\u00ed made completely in accordance with the [i]paranoiac-critical method[/i], a surrealist technique he developed in the 1930s. The technique required the artist to enter a unique state of mind which he described as a \u201cspontaneous method of irrational knowledge, based on the critical-interpretative association of the phenomena of delirium\u201d. It was particularly effective when creating an optical illusion, of one image hidden within another. In this way, Dal\u00ed was able to emphasize the passage of time, and the process of the metamorphosis.\n \nWhile in London in 1938, the writer Stefan Zweig arranged a meeting between Dal\u00ed and the renowned psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Dal\u00ed, a great admirer of Freud, brought with him [i]Metamorphosis of Narcissus[/i] as an example of his work. The following day, Freud wrote to Zweig: \u201cuntil now I was inclined to regard the Surrealists \u2013 who seem to have chosen me as their patron saint \u2013 as 100% mad (let\u2019s say 95%, as with alcohol). This young Spaniard, with his ingenuous fanatical eyes and his undeniable technical mastery, has suggested to me a different appreciation. In fact, it would be very interesting to explore analytically the creation of such a painting.\u201d"

        "description": "George Luks, a realist painter associated with Robert Henri and the Ashcan school, chose the crowded streets of New York City, and the urban and rural poor as his subjects. He is noted for his broadly-brushed paintings of miners, elderly women, immigrant children, and wrestlers (see 45.9). In a lesser-known chapter of his life, Luks painted more than a dozen oils and watercolors during an extended visit to Boston in 1922 and 1923. He was the guest of a former student, Margarett Sargent McKean, a cousin of John Singer Sargent and an aspiring artist. Margarett Sargent had been an apprentice of sculptor Gutzon Borglum in 1917, when she met Luks and began to study painting with him. By the late 1920s, she was painting strikingly modernist oils and began to exhibit her work at Kraushaar Galleries in New York.\r\n\r\nIn 1922 Luks, fresh from a sanitarium where he was recovering from a bout with alcohol and recently divorced from his second wife, visited Sargent. By this time she was married to Quincy Adams Shaw McKean, a private banker in Boston. She later recalled that Luks had come to visit her for a weekend, but had stayed for almost a year. Not only did McKean provide living quarters for Luks, she also allowed him the use of her studio at 30 St. Botolph Street and organized an exhibition of his work in her summer home in Beverly, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nMcKean remembered that Luks disdained the Boston painters who remained in their prim studios painting hired nude models. He exclaimed, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they look at Beacon Hill, Commonwealth Avenue, the Swan Boats, fruit vendors on Charles Street, the squalor of St. Botolph Street and the vigorous L. Street Brownies?\u201d (Margarett Sargent McKean, \u201cGeorge Luks,\u201d Boston: Joan Peterson Gallery, 1966, brochure in MFA American paintings files). Luks threw himself into painting these subjects in Boston (see 60.538 and 1979.263). In \u201cNoontime, St. Botolph Street, Boston,\u201d he depicted the scene outside Margarett\u2019s studio at midday when the shadows cast by the awnings were very pronounced against the old-fashioned bow-front facades of the buildings. These elliptical bays protruding from the structures on St. Botolph Street and elsewhere in the Back Bay and the South End were constructed beginning in the 1840s. They were peculiar to Boston and almost unknown in Luks\u2019s New York City. St. Botolph Street is situated between the Back Bay and South End sections of Boston. Laid out in the early 1880s, St. Botolph Street initially attracted middleclass residents. By the early 1920s when Luks was painting in the area, most of the middleclass families had moved to the suburbs, the neighborhood had become more Bohemian, and many of the townhouses had been turned into lodging houses.\r\n\r\nIn addition to painting the striped awnings against the yellow- and red-brick facades on St. Botolph Street, Luks also included an iceman carrying a block of ice with tongs. To the left is probably a part of the ice wagon\u2019s wheel. Before refrigerators were introduced into most homes in the 1930s, food was stored in iceboxes, and blocks of ice were delivered door to door by an iceman. Luks\u2019s inclusion of this unglamorous figure was typical of the Ashcan school artists, who made working people, from longshoremen to scrubwomen, the subjects of their pictures. Luks painted a related work entitled \u201cSt. Botolph Street,\u201d depicting women sitting on their stoops socializing on a summer\u2019s evening (\u201cSkinner: American and European Paintings,\u201d May 8, 1998, lot 220).\r\n\r\nMargarett Sargent McKean and her husband acquired many of Luks\u2019s Boston paintings, including \u201cNoontime, St. Botolph Street, Boston.\u201d In 1960 the Museum purchased two of Luks\u2019s Boston pictures, the present painting and \u201cView of Beacon Street from Boston Common\u201d (60.538)."

The image painted on the canvas also merges with the actual image outside of the doorway, making a seamless transition between the two. Magritte recycled this theme recurrently throughout his painting career, making many variations on the theme of including a painting within a painting, hiding whatever lies behind. "

She was a native of France and always went back and forth between English and French.\nIn this period in the 1940s, she was raising three small boys, and so she was certainly thinking of how she felt trying to be an artist and also a stay at home mother. She chose architectural imagery to, in effect, suffocate this woman. It\u2019s kind of dire, in a way. But on the other hand, the woman stands very upright with a certain dignity. And we can tell it's a self-portrait because the hair that comes out of the house was a signifier of Bourgeois\u2019 own long hair.\n\nArchitecture was a motif she used throughout her career to symbolize her feelings. She saw architectural structures as a place of refuge. On the other hand, she saw that an architectural structure could also be a trap.\n\nBourgeois' [i]Femme Maison[/i] imagery became a symbol of the feminist art movement in the late 60s and in the 70s. Women, in particular, brought attention to the body and to issues of biography and personal feelings into artworks. Bourgeois had always been dealing with these things, so the Femme Maison image was very resonant with feminist artists, and I find that it's still resonant with women.\n\n[u]Deborah Wye for MOMA[/u]"

The other theme is that of placing objects together in an unusual context. Unlike other surrealist artists, who mixed dreamlike images with abstract shapes, Magritte\u2019s works included normal images, placed in surreal contextual situations. The Listening Room is one such painting, portraying a regular green apple, which just so happens to be large enough to fill an entire room."

The female head on the left has pallid white skin and closed eyes, while the male head is depicted with its mouth and eyes open, staring vacantly past the viewer. The jagged, rough marks on the neck reveal the brutal and painful death. These figures suffered at the guillotine. Here Gericault shows his brilliant mastery of [i]chiaroscuro[/i], seen in the contrasts of dark and light throughout the composition. The loose brushstrokes used to render both the faces and the cloth add to the work's dramatic appeal.\n\nSevered limbs and body parts are the most striking subject in G\u00e9ricault's oeuvre. The five works he created in this style are considered to be studies for the figures he would render in his most famous work, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/the-raft-of-the-medusa-1819][i]The Raft of the Medusa[/i][/url] (1818-1819). Always striving for authenticity, the artist kept dead body parts of victims of the guillotine in his studio. G\u00e9riault's use of horrific subject matter was first and foremost an artistic means of pushing the boundaries, but also the vehicle of a political message. By so clearly depicting the savagery involved in the use of the guillotine and presenting it in such a direct and confrontational way, G\u00e9ricault is visually speaking out against this brutal form of punishment, which had been used widely during the Bourbon Restoration."

The painting depicts the River Stour, which separates Suffolk and Essex, with Willy Lott's cottage to the left. The cart in the painting might have been positioned in the water to prevent the wooden wheels from shrinking in the sun and loosening their metal rims.\n\nThe painting emanates positivity and peacefulness, conveyed through the use of color. The cool tones of the water reflect the blue of the sky, and the red of the horse's harness highlights the terracotta of the house. The greens and yellows of the vegetation frame the entire image, and the meadow on the right of the canvas opens up space to the viewer. The river's curve in the foreground directs attention towards the Hay Wain, the central focus of the painting. Constable's signature flecks of white paint on the water's surface represent the noon sunshine's reflection on the river.\n\nThe painting's size (another six-footer) and the meticulously crafted light effect give the impression that the viewer is standing on the near bank of the river and can enter the scene. The painting celebrates nature's beauty without embellishment or exaggeration and reflects Constable's dedication to depicting reality as he saw it. This approach gives the scene an authentic and sincere quality that is immediately recognizable to the viewer."

Reynolds was an avid theater enthusiast, and his connections in the industry helped him expand his clientele. Garrick was a close friend of Reynolds, and the image represents his dual identity as an actor caught between the two genres. This theme of duality was frequently employed by Reynolds, as seen in works like Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse, where the figures of Terror and Fear lurk in the shadows.\n\nThe clothing and postures of the women signify their respective roles, demonstrating Reynolds' penchant for using symbolism in his portraits. However, the painting also carries a broader allusion, drawing a comparison between Garrick's theatrical choice and that of Hercules in classical mythology. Hercules had to choose between Virtue and Vice, often depicted as allegorical figures in works of the time. Reynolds' comparison of Garrick with Hercules serves as a humorous commentary on 18th century concepts of heroism. While many appreciated this lighthearted approach, some, including the American-British artist Benjamin West, found it irreverent and disrespectful to classical art traditions."

The soft color scheme enables the viewer to focus on the central subject of the scene, which is the close bond between the mother and child. Their intimacy is evident from their proximity and the circle of touch that extends from the woman's hand on the child's foot to the child's hand on the woman's knee.

        "description": "Although Jan Steen is primarily known for portraying lively scenes of peasant life, he produced at least 60 paintings that dealt with biblical, mythological and historical subjects. [i]Wrath of Ahasuerus[/i] refers to the story of Esther in the [i]Old Testament[/i]. Esther, was a Jewish queen and wife of Ahasuerus, the King of Persia. Ahasuerus, captivated by Esther\u2019s beauty, selected her for his wife, but did not know that she was Jewish. At the same time, Ahasuerus\u2019s chief minister, Haman, plotted to annihilate the Jews in the Persian Empire. Esther, determined to save her people, prepared a banquet for Ahasuerus and Haman, with the intention of exposing Haman to the King. In the end, Esther was triumphant, Haman was sentenced to death and Esther secured a decree from Ahasuerus that allowed the Jews to defend themselves against their enemies. The painting depicts the most dramatic moment, after Esther reveals her Jewish identity and accuses Haman of plotting against her and her people.\n\nIn Steen\u2019s time, there was a renewed interest in stories from the [i]Old Testament[/i], especially in the story of Esther. The subject was explored by Jan Steen and other artists, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url] in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/ahasuerus-xerxes-haman-and-esther][i]Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther[/i][/url] (1660). As the country was engaged in continuous war throughout most of the 16th and 17th century, there were parallels between the Dutch and the Jews and their fight for liberation. In this manner, the story of Esther appealed to the Dutch because it represented the unyielding struggle for freedom against a foreign power.\n\n[i]Wrath of Ahasuerus[/i] closely relates to another painting by Steen, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/esther-ahasuerus-and-haman-1668][i]Esther, Ahasuerus and Haman[/i][/url] (ca. 1668). [i]Wrath of Ahasuerus[/i] is a version of the central image in [i]Esther, Ahasuerus and Haman[/i], except that the artist switches the positions of Esther and Haman. In style, the painting embodies the spirit of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/baroque#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Baroque[/url] in its extravagance and richness of detail. Steen dramatized the moment through the gestures of the main figures in the forefront and the servants in the backdrop; as well as the peacock pie falling from the table, which symbolizes the humiliation and fall of Haman. At the same time, the artist brings to the painting familiar aspects of Dutch life and art, such as the appearance of the furniture, the tableware and, most importantly, the composition of still life on the table.\n\nJan Steen, like many of his contemporaries, was also influenced by the theater. In many cities the [i]Rederijkers[/i], the Dutch guild of Rhetoricians, had very close relationships with painter\u2019s guilds. This resulted in a fruitful exchange of ideas between the two organizations. There is evidence that Steen was closely connected to members of the [i]Rederijkers[/i], and this theatrical influence comes through in many of his paintings, especially in depictions of biblical subjects. In [i]Wrath of Ahasuerus[/i], Ahasuerus\u2019s theatrical gesture can correspond with the speech on stage: \u201c[i]Shame on thee, Haman, now curse the hour of thy birth[/i]\u201d. In the same way, Haman is cowering humiliated, crying in despair: \u201c[i]Where shall I hide myself? I dare not look upon the face of the king[/i]\u201d."

Its major movement is the journey taken by an Italian Femme Fetale that begins on a New York City subway platform awaiting her metaphorical \u201ctrain\u201d and her journey continues -- painting by painting -- like a roller coaster ride through her mind.  \r\n \r\nGetaway Car follows our Italian Femme Fetale into an Off-Duty Taxi at night (Getaway Car) with the artist using himself as a model in the mirror self-portrait.

Her style was figurative and self-taught, with elements of the fantastical and an emphasis on her own individual, biographical perspective. Her self-referential art, now a media phenomenon, originated in the development of her portrait painting which, from early on, became her most effective device for expressing a certain unease about exploring her own personality.\n\nIn 1938, Andr\u00e9 Breton labeled Kahlo's work as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/surrealism]surrealist[/url], leading to [i]The Two Fridas[/i] being exhibited at the [i]International Exhibition of Surrealism[/i], organized by the Gallery of Mexican Art in 1940. This double [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url] is one of Kahlo's most recognized compositions and is symbolic of the artist's emotional pain experienced during her divorce from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Rivera[/url]. On the left, the artist is shown in modern European attire, wearing the costume from her marriage to Rivera. Throughout their marriage, given Rivera's strong nationalism, Kahlo became increasingly interested in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/indigenism]Indigenism[/url] and began to explore traditional Mexican costume, which she wears in the portrait on the right. It is the Mexican Kahlo that holds a locket with an image of Rivera. The stormy sky in the background, and the artist's bleeding heart - a fundamental symbol of Catholicism and also symbolic of Aztec ritual sacrifice - accentuate Kahlo's personal tribulation and physical pain.\n\nSymbolic elements frequently possess multiple layers of meaning in Kahlo's pictures; the recurrent theme of blood represents both metaphysical and physical suffering, gesturing also to the artist's ambivalent attitude toward accepted notions of womanhood and fertility. Although both women have their hearts exposed, the woman in the white European outfit also seems to have had her heart dissected and the artery that runs from this heart is cut and bleeding. The artery that runs from the heart of her Tehuana-costumed self remains intact because it is connected to the miniature photograph of Diego as a child. Whereas Kahlo's heart in the Mexican dress remains sustained, the European Kahlo, disconnected from her beloved Diego, bleeds profusely onto her dress. As well as being one of the artist's most famous works, this is also her largest canvas."

        "description": "In 1929 Wood wrote to his mother that he had found 'a very good painting place'. He was writing from Dieppe where he had arrived a few days earlier with his friend Frosca Munster. The Normandy port, renowned for its scallops and herrings brought in by the fishing fleet, had attracted many artists, notably Walter Sickert (1862-1942) who had painted the buildings of the town, and Georges Braque (1882-1963). Braque had visited Dieppe in 1928, and built a house and a small studio in nearby Varengeville the following year. He painted the foreshore and studies of small boats, which Wood may have seen. Furthermore Dieppe would have reminded Wood of St Ives, where he had stayed with his friends Ben (1894-1982) and Winifred Nicholson (1893-1981) a few months earlier. There he had become fascinated with boats and the traditional life of fishing communities, a subject that was to become a recurring theme in his paintings during his last years.\nA Fishing Boat in Dieppe Harbour is characteristic of many of Wood's paintings from the late 1920s. Many art historians, including Charles Harrison, have made comparisons between these paintings and the work of Alfred Wallis (1855-1942). Wood had met Wallis, a reclusive seventy year old Cornish fisherman, whilst staying in St Ives in 1928. Harrison suggests that, following frequent visits to Wallis's studio to see his na\u00efve paintings of sailing boats on irregular shaped pieces of cardboard and wood, Wood's paintings became 'more robust in shape and colour' (Harrison, p.189). Wood's interest in the design of Wallis's little pictures is evident from the manner in which he allows the boat to dominate the composition. In addition, as Ingleby remarked, the boat 'is poised at an angle to the sea, like an object on a table top' (Ingleby, p.213). This enabled Wood, who himself was an experienced sailor, to include details of the equipment and rigging. Behind the harbour wall he paints the tall cliffs, the homes of the fishermen in Le Pollet and a weather vane, which appears to be out of scale to the rest of the scene. In contrast to many of the pictures Wood made at Dieppe, in which he used a neutral palette of black, white, greys and creams, A Fishing Boat in Dieppe Harbour is richly coloured. The turquoise sea and threatening grey sky contrasts with the brightly coloured houses and yellow wooden boards in the boat.\nA preparatory drawing for this painting in the collection of Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums reveals that, despite its childlike appearance, Wood thought carefully about the composition of the finished work. Sophie Barthelemy suggests that he 'integrated it [the boat] fully into a complex interplay of lines, and colours values, creating a composition that is at once densely structured and rigorously simplified' ."

Critics have interpreted these works as potent expressions of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, an idea of great currency in the late 19th century. [i]Fox Hunt[/i] was Homer's largest canvas. He dramatized the brutal realities of winter on the Maine coast by showing a fox desperately bounding through deep snow in an attempt to flee a flock of half-starved crows. The birds descend ominously with outstretched wings, forming a dark hovering mass above the struggling fox. However, the sharp diagonal created by the fox, matched by the artist's signature in the lower-left corner, suggests a sense of motion for the animal and allows the viewer to determine the conclusion to this dramatic scene.\n\nThat viewers witness the scene from the fox's vantage point heighten's sense of tension and empathy. Homer's carefully designed composition, indebted to his study of Japanese woodblock prints ( seen on his Paris trip in 1876), supports the unfolding drama. The fox's red silhouette is splashed across a field of oppressive snow; we sense that he is cornered, trapped within the flattened white plane while the aggressive birds break its edges on the descent. This striking reversal of the natural order, in which the bird becomes predator and the fox prey, has become one of the artist's most haunting and successful images. The Pennsylvania Academy purchased [i]Fox Hunt[/i] in 1893, the first of Homer's works to enter a public collection."

In the background is a fine depiction of a sculptured torso done by the painter's younger brother, Ben (Bendet/Beniek) Moncznik (later, Munn), who lived with Jacob, his wife Sonia, and her sister Fanny approximately 1937\u20131939 in Paris. [Ben was a brief and largely unknown member of the \u00c9cole de Paris. Although he survived the Holocaust, he did not return to sculpture. His pre-war sculptures have never surfaced.]\n\nThis painting is privately held by the artist's nephew. Denotation of the copyright is embedded within this low resolution image of the painting."

        "description": "William Rush and His Model is the name given to several paintings by Thomas Eakins, one set from 1876-77 and the other from 1908. These works depict the American wood sculptor William Rush in 1808, carving his statue Water Nymph and Bittern for a fountain at Philadelphia's first waterworks. Eakins's interest in William Rush originated from a desire to restore Rush's name to prominence in the history of American art. Eakins taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, of which Rush had been a founder. Eakins was a strong believer in teaching human anatomy, and insisted that his students study from nude models. Since it is unlikely that Rush had employed a nude model for his sculpture of a draped water nymph, the painting may be viewed as Eakins's demonstration of the importance of studying anatomy from nudes."

The hard material of the mountain is transfigured in an almost metaphysical vision. It almost entirely occupies the space of the canvas, capturing attention without accessory elements that can distract the look.\n\nThe painter filled a large painting with cold colors, from white to ice, to violet, to green, to petrol green: Harris was not satisfied with the spot colors, he succeeded in elaborating a chromatic range made of many shades. The colors chase each other on the canvas, from the dark to the light of the top of the mountain, and draw the gaze towards the top of the hill. The clouds are not realistic: they take up the shape of the mountain, of triangular lines, and there is no sun passing through them. The light captured by the ice on the top of the hill is not a natural light, it is an illumination, which gives to the image a character of revelation, a spiritual stature. According to the creed of Harris, who was an adept of Theosophy, \"[i]Art is the beginning of vision into the realm of eternal life.[/i]\""

        "description": "[i]The Yellow Cow[/i] (1911) is one of the first examples that exhibit Marc's mature style. It stands in contrast with Marc's early style, and his previous depictions of animals, in paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/deer-at-dusk-1909][i]Deer at Dusk[/i][/url] (1909) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/grazing-horses-1910][i]Grazing Horses[/i][/url] (1910). These paintings were naturalistic and reflected many hours spent painting outdoors. From the outset, Marc was drawn to nature, to the movement and behavior of animals. He was not unique here, as 'back to nature' movement swept Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Artistic collectives and nudist colonies emerged in agricultural areas in response to an overall dissatisfaction with an increasingly materialistic and secular society. Artists sought a more essential and spiritual existence in nature, and eventually, Marc left the city for the small Bavarian village, Sindelsdorf. As [i]Deer at Dusk[/i] and [i]Grazing Horses[/i] show, Marc sketched and observed cows and horses in the meadows of Bavaria and deer in the forest. For Marc, animals had certain godliness and spirituality that man no longer possessed. Animals were his primary subjects throughout his artistic evolution.\n\nIn [i]The Yellow Cow,[/i] the artist strived to convey his spiritual ideals, and his primary means of expression was color. Marc's interest in color can be traced to his admiration for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent Van Gogh[/url], who developed a theory of color symbolism. From his correspondences, we know that Marc discussed Van Gogh's perception of color with fellow artists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/august-macke]August Macke[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/wassily-kandinsky]Wassily Kandinsky[/url]. Marc formed his color theory: he ascribed characteristics to each color and outlined complementary and harmonious color combinations. Blue related to masculinity, spirituality, and severity, and yellow represented femininity, qualities of joy, gentility, and sensuality. The third primary color, red, represented matter, it was brutal and heavy and opposed to the other two.\n\n[i]The Yellow Cow[/i] embodies Marc's female principle by exuding joyfulness and abundance. In order to balance the yellow, Marc created a vibrant landscape with patches of red, blue and green. According to one interpretation, [i]The Yellow Cow[/i] is a private wedding portrait that Marc made in honor of his union with Maria Franck in 1911. The pair attempted to get the necessary permits to get married in Germany, but they were denied twice. In 1911, they traveled to England to get married, even though their marriage was not legally valid in Germany. Still, the couple resided together and considered themselves husband and wife. In the painting, the cow would represent Maria, and Marc's self-portrait would be veiled in the blue mountains in the background. Whether this interpretation is accurate or not, the painting has a jubilant and cheerful quality. This quality sets it apart from other paintings by Marc, which had a dark and ominous tone. For example, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/fate-of-the-animals][i]Fate of the Animals[/i][/url] (1913) shows the animals as innocent victims caught in flames, fleeing, and struggling."

His [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]interest in self-portraiture[/url] was especially pronounced in 1888 and 1889, in part because of his relationship with his fellow artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent Van Gogh[/url]. Gauguin stayed with Van Gogh in Arles for two months in 1888, and afterward, the two continued to exchange artistic ideas through correspondence.\n\nPainted on a cupboard door, [i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] presents an image that is both angelic and demonic. The artist includes three Christian symbols in the painting \u2013 the yellow halo over his head, the apples that dangle from a branch on the left, and the snake which he holds in his right hand. Together these symbols reference the biblical story of the Temptation of Adam and Eve and the Fall of Man. By combining these symbols, Gauguin presents himself as both a saint and a sinner or a figure of a fallen angel. This duality is also evident in the composition of the painting: the top half depicts Gauguin with the halo looking away from the temptation (apples) while the bottom half shows grasping the snake. The image possibly reflects the artist\u2019s inner struggle as well as the enigmatic way in which he wished to portray himself to others.\n\nIn the painting, there is no sense of spatial dimension, and the large areas of flat colors demonstrate the influence of Japanese prints and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cloisonnism]Cloisonnism[/url] \u2013 a post-impressionist style characterized by bold flat forms enclosed by dark outlines. Another important influence in [i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting]ancient Egyptian art[/url] and imagery. The shape of Gauguin\u2019s long hair is similar to the ceremonial wigs of Egyptian gods, Pharaohs, and court officials. Gauguin was familiar with these conventions through the plaster cast of the Giza [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/khafre-enthroned--2570]sculpture of The Pharaoh Khephren[/url] at the Ethnographic Museum of Trocad\u00e9ro and the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/the-goddess-hathor-welcomes-sethos-i--1069]Relief from the Tomb of Sethos I[/url] at the Louvre. The Egyptian influence is also evident in the way Gauguin paints the hand and the snake. The snake was possibly modeled after the snake symbol featured on Pharaoh\u2019s personal emblem on the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/stele-of-the-serpent-king-stela-of-djet--3000]Stela of Djet[/url] at the Louvre. The grasp of the snake is not realistic, and the hand is depicted from a frontal view which is characteristic of Egyptian reliefs and wall paintings. In the foreground of the painting, Gauguin added an ornamental element of a vine-like plant or flower. The vines could have been modeled after the lotus and the papyrus plant, that were often featured on Egyptian reliefs, sculptures, and wall paintings.  \n\n[i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] is a companion piece to [[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/portrait-of-meyer-de-haan-by-lamplight-1889]i]Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan[/i][/url] (1889). The two works were intended to be part of a decorative panel in Gauguin\u2019s dwelling in the village Le Pouldu. The companion portrait depicts Gauguin\u2019s close friend, the Dutch painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/meijer-de-haan]Meijer de Haan[/url] in the pose of a thinker. The redhaired painter is staring at two books, John Milton\u2019s [i]Paradise Lost[/i] and Thomas Carlyle\u2019s [i]Sartor Resartus[/i], contemplating issues of religion and philosophy. Some have suggested that the portraits address similar themes through different references: both present the artist in a sort of inner struggle and as figures that have a strong connection to the spiritual and mystical realm."

        "description": "In 1893 on a short return visit to the United States, Tanner painted his most famous work, The Banjo Lesson, while in Philadelphia. The painting shows an elderly black man teaching a boy, assumed to be his grandson, how to play the banjo. This deceptively simple-looking work explores several important themes. Blacks had long been stereotyped as entertainers in American culture, and the image of a black man playing the banjo appears throughout American art of the late 19th century. Thomas Worth, Willy Miller, Walter M. Dunk, Eastman Johnson, and Tanner\u2019s teacher Thomas Eakins had tackled the subject in their artwork.\r\nThese images are often reduced to a minstrel-type portrayal. Tanner painted a sensitive reinterpretation. Instead of a generalization, the painting portrays a specific moment of human interaction. The two characters concentrate intently on the task before them. They seem to be oblivious to the rest of the world, which enlarges the sense of real contact and cooperation. The skillfully painted portraits of the individuals make it obvious that these are real people and not types.\r\nIn addition to being a meaningful exploration of human qualities, the piece is masterfully painted. Tanner undertakes the difficult endeavor of portraying two separate and varying light sources. A natural white, blue glow from outside enters from the left while the warm light from a fireplace is apparent on the right. The figures are illuminated where the two light sources meet; some have hypothesized this as a manifestation of Tanner\u2019s situation in transition between two worlds, his American past and his newfound home in France."

        "description": "[i]Whaam![/i] (1963) is a two-canvas painting based on an image from the comic book strip [i]All-American Men of War[/i], published by DC Comics in February 1962. The left canvas depicts an American fighter plane firing a missile that hits an approaching enemy plane seen on the right canvas. The bright yellow letters \u2018WHAAM!\u2019 blaze out of the exploding airplane, describing the impact of the attack. The artist got the idea for [i]Whaam![/i] while working on [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/tex-1962][i]Tex![/i][/url] (1962), a smaller, single panel painting that has a similar composition of a plane shooting at an enemy aircraft. The artist explained the idea of the two-canvas painting in a letter he wrote in 1967: \u201cI remember being concerned with the idea of doing almost separate paintings having a little hint of compositional connection, and each having slightly separate stylistic character. Of course, there is the humorous connection of one panel shooting the other.\u201d\n\nIn the painting, Lichtenstein imitates the tradition of printed comic strips in the thick black lines that outline areas of primary colors, and the uniform areas of Ben-Day dots in the purple shading of the fighter plane and the sky in the background. He found this style of comic book strips and cartoons particularly appealing because it allowed him to depict emotionally charged, dramatic subject matters, like love and war, in a detached and calculated manner. In his paintings, Lichtenstein drew inspiration from popular imagery in advertising, comic books, and cartoons. Although his paintings have an element of appropriation, the artist transformed these images in his paintings. The \u2018low\u2019 mass-produced image from a comic book is transferred to the realm of high art in the traditional medium of a large-scale easel painting.\n\nDuring the first half of the 1960s, Lichtenstein created multiple war paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/bratatat-1963][i]Bratatat![/i][/url] (1963), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/okay-hot-shot-okay-1963][i]Okay Hot-Shot, Okay![/i][/url] (1963) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/as-i-opened-fire-1964][i]As I Opened Fire[/i][/url] (1964). Like [i]Whaam![/i] these were inspired by comic book images that glorified military action and heroism. In Lichtenstein\u2019s paintings, these images become ironic and juvenile. Lichtenstein who served in the US Army between 1943 and 1946, painted these war paintings at a time when the Vietnam War was gaining steam. By emphasizing the irony and ridiculousness of the scenes, the artist deconstructs military heroism and glorified action-packed violence. In a 1963 interview, Lichtenstein stated: \u201cThe heroes depicted in comic books are fascist types, but I don\u2019t take them seriously in these paintings \u2013 maybe there is a point in not taking them seriously, a political point.\u201d Therefore, paintings like [i]Whaam![/i] can be interpreted as artworks that emphasize the foolishness and absurdity of war.\n\nThe complexity of the [i]Whaam![/i] lies in its contrasts and dualities \u2013 an emotionally charged subject presented in a detached style, a commercial image placed in a fine art context, and a mass-produced image becoming a unique artwork in the form of a painting. These dualities were characteristics of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pop-art]Pop art[/url] and were explored by Lichtenstein and his contemporaries, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol]Andy Warhol[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claes-oldenburg]Claes Oldenburg[/url]."

        "description": "The painting [i]Villagers and Saints[/i] (1933) by Stanley Spencer was painted shortly after the artist returned to his place of birth, the historic village of Cookham. Spencer was inspired by Cookham to which he often referred as \u201ca village in Heaven\u201d. Paintings such as [i]Villagers and Saints[/i] (1933) express the artist\u2019s experience in Cookham: \u201cQuite suddenly I became aware that everything was full of special meaning, and this made everything holy... I observed the sacred quality in the most unexpected quarters.\u201d [i]Villagers and Saints[/i], along with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stanley-spencer/sarah-tubb-and-the-heavenly-visitors-1933][i]Sarah Tubb and the Heavenly Visitors[/i][/url] (1933) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stanley-spencer/separating-fighting-swans-1933][i]Separating Fighting Swans[/i][/url] (1933), belongs to the Pentecost scheme that Spencer started in 1933. The group of paintings depicts angels and saints visiting the village of Cookham as they take part in various activities.\n\nIn [i]Villagers and Saints[/i], Spencer creates a scene that blends heaven and earth \u2013 a setting in which the villagers and the saints cohabitate. The scene is not only a divine event in a village setting. In his vision, Spencer goes a step further, blurring the separation between the heavenly and the earthly. The composition of the painting flows from left to right across two lines that coincide with the final figure of the man in the grey underwear.  The male figure can be described as \u2018half-way to a saint\u2019, a figure in a transitional state of \u2018becoming\u2019. This is conveyed by his clothing: unlike the other villagers, he is stripped to his outer garments but is still not wearing the white robes of the saints. His facial expression reflects his transitional state between villager and saint. He appears to be in a trance, between drunkenness and meditation.\n\nPainting such as [i]Villagers and Saints[/i] articulate Spencer\u2019s unique understanding of Christianity. In the work, Spencer combines the religious and the ordinary \u2013 the villagers are connecting to the saintly and spiritual world, while the saints exist in the physical world. By blurring the lines between the heavenly and the earthly, Spencer elevates the ordinary activities that make up daily life in Cookham. For instance, the mundane scene of two boys in grey and red marbles gains new meaning. In the divine environment, the boys absorbed in the game can be understood as a reference to heaven on earth. As is the case with most of his religious paintings, the scene in [i]Villagers and Saints[/i] is set outdoors, in a public space. The public setting allows Spencer to include figures such as the rag and bone man (a scavenger that collects unwanted items to sell to merchants), who is rummaging through the sack on the top left. Spencer added an open book at the bottom of the painting. Even though the text is illegible, the layout of the page suggests that it is a Bible.\n\nElements in the painting show the influence of Flemish art on Spencer. The female saint on the left is reminiscent of the figures in nativity paintings of 15th-century artists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rogier-van-der-weyden]Rogier van der Weyden[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hugo-van-der-goes]Hugo van der Goes[/url]. Additionally, the color scheme of the painting is similar to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-brueghel-the-younger/christ-and-the-adulteress][i]Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery[/i][/url] (ca. 1600) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-brueghel-the-younger]Pieter Brueghel the Younger[/url]."

With her biting wit, matronly hairstyle, and deep voice, the television comedienne is an unconventional choice for this type of portrait, which typically features a very feminine, youthful subject. Currin does not depict Arthur in a particularly erotic or sexualized manner, but instead presents a thought-provoking challenge to the viewer. By presenting the plainspoken Arthur in the nude on a flat yellow background, he interrogates the ageism associated with sexuality in much of late twentieth century popular culture, as well as long-standing artistic conventions."

In 1797, he travelled with Lord Macartney to South Africa on a diplomatic mission to settle the government of the new colony of the Cape of Good Hope. Barrow was appointed Second Secretary to the Admiralty in 1804. In this capacity he promoted British exploration, most notably of West Africa and the North Polar Region, with attempts to find a north-west passage from east to west through the Canadian Arctic."

In an interview in connection with her 70th birthday, she said: \u201cThere was a time when I lacked subjects to paint. I thought about this day and night. And then one night I had a dream. I saw under a cross in a graveyard a meeting of a mother and daughter. The mother kneeled and the daughter bent over her. One of them had died. This meeting in the graveyard was so vivid for me that the next day I started to paint it.\u201d We do not know whether the mother has folded her hands in prayer or despair, or even who the two women are, but Anna Ancher\u2019s mother was the model for the mother. The painting represents one of the few examples of the otherwise naturalistic Skagen painter utilizing a Symbolist idiom.\n\n[url href=https://skagenskunstmuseer.dk/en/works/grief/]skagenskunstmuseer[/url]"

The artist shows herself majestically seated on a red velvet tasselled chair, which contrasts with the usual sombre, dark clothing that she can be seen wearing throughout most of her self-portraits. In earlier portraits she paints herself at an easel with brushes and palettes in hand, playing a musical instrument, or holding the emblems of her noble family - attributes that she promoted as a prospective young courtier. Here she shows herself as a woman of letters. In her right hand she is holding a letter, while she holds a book in her left hand, marking her place with her index finger between the pages. Anguissola's lined face and deeply hooded eyes suggest that she recognizes that this painting might be her last as she maintains eye contact with the viewer. She understood the power of art to survive through time, and uses it here to commemorate her own life and reputation."

It was based on a much smaller version of the same scene, presently held by the Yale University Art Gallery. Trumbull painted many of the figures in the picture from life and visited Independence Hall as well to depict the chamber where the Second Continental Congress met. The oil-on-canvas work was commissioned in 1817, purchased in 1819, and placed in the rotunda in 1826.\r\n\r\nThe painting is sometimes incorrectly described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence. In fact, the painting actually shows the five-man drafting committee presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.\r\n\r\nThe painting shows 42 of the 56 signers of the Declaration; Trumbull originally intended to include all 56 signers, but was unable to obtain likenesses for all of them. He also decided to depict several participants in the debate who did not sign the document, including John Dickinson, who declined to sign. Because the Declaration was debated and signed over a period of time when membership in Congress changed, the men in the painting had never all been in the same room at the same time.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson seems to be stepping on the foot of John Adams in the painting, which many think is supposed to symbolize their relationship as political enemies. However, upon closer examination of the painting, it can be seen that their feet are merely close together. This part of the image was correctly depicted on the two-dollar bill version."

        "description": "In 1937-38, the painter Stanley Spencer produced an intimate series of eight paintings called [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stanley-spencer/all-works#!#filterName:Series_the-beautitudes,resultType:masonry][i]The Beatitudes[/i][/url].  The series was created during a time of personal crisis, and it explored the difficult topics of love, desire, and infatuation.  In mid-1937 Spencer divorced from his first wife Hilda and then married Patricia Preece. The marriage with Preece was a failure, and she continued to live with her partner, the painter Dorothy Hepworth. In [i]The Beatitudes[/i] Spencer explored his emotional turmoil, dedicating each painting to a specific element that relates to love and sexual attraction.\n\nThe scheme of the series, in which each painting focuses on a particular theme is similar to an earlier series from 1935-1936 called [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stanley-spencer/all-works#!#filterName:Series_domestic-scenes,resultType:masonry][i]Domestic Scenes[/i][/url] which dealt with intimate interactions between Spencer and his first wife Hilda, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stanley-spencer/choosing-a-petticoat-1936][i]Choosing a Petticoat[/i][/url] (1936) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stanley-spencer/going-to-bed][i]Going to Bed[/i][/url] (1936). The message of domestic harmony and togetherness seems to dissipate in [i]The Beatitudes[/i], a series that centers around his relationship with Preece. The figures in the series are grotesque and comic characters, often distorted and disfigured. The male figures in the series tend to have characteristics attributed to Spencer, they are usually smaller and dominated by their female counterparts.\n\n[i]Beatitude 8: Worship[/i] (1938) follows this dynamic, the male figures that resemble Spencer seem to be dwarfed and overwhelmed by the female figures. In the foreground, the two men are in kneeling positions as the large female bodies tower over them. Similarly, the two further figures seem to be absorbed by the group of women in front of them. The dominant figure in white is usually interpreted as Preece. She is surrounded by numerous gifts: cased jewelry, perfume, coins, and wads of money. The theme of gifts had personal significance to Spencer. He lavished Preece with expensive presents, accumulating substantial amounts of debt that almost led him to financial ruin. In particular, the jewelry placed directly underneath Preece\u2019s dress highlights the transactional nature of the relationship: the man bows down powerless, buying gifts in return for the woman\u2019s favor.\n\nAccording to Spencer, each painting portrayed \u201cthe twined and unified souls of two persons. The composition turns two into one person and becomes a single organism\u201d. In paintings like [i]Beatitude 8: Worship[/i], Spencer purposefully distorted the figures, making them grotesque and ugly to the viewer. This made the series unpopular with Spencer\u2019s older patrons. One of them, Wilfred Evill, recalled talking to Spencer about [i]Beatitude 8: Worship[/i]: \u201cI asked him why he had made the desired ladies so hideous, he said: \u2018I have painted them as they are, go and look at them in the Tube\u2019\u201d. The statement indicates that Spencer wanted to express his emotional response to different interactions and attitudes through these distortions. For Spencer, the series was not satirical, instead, it represents his profound insights on human love and desire. In this way, the artist suggests that human love, even in its highest form should not be expressed through beauty, but rather through the grotesque figures in [i]The Beatitudes[/i]."

        "description": "[i]Portrait of a Jester with a Lute[/i] (ca. 1623-1624) is an example of 17th-century Dutch [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting]genre painting[/url]. This term refers to paintings that depict occurrences of everyday life, ordinary people engaged in daily activities. At times, the portrayal of lower classes in genre paintings, such as peasants, musicians, merry drinkers, and promiscuous women, had a didactic dimension. The moral judgment focused on sensory pleasures and the dangers associated with these pleasures. Thus, [i]Portrait of a Jester with a Lute[/i] may be an allegorical portrait, which speaks about the vanity of music as fleeting pleasure. The choice of subject was likely influenced by the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/utrecht-school]Utrecht Caravaggisti[/url], a group of Dutch Baroque painters profoundly influenced by the art of Italian painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url]. Depictions of lute players by the Utrecht Caravaggisti include [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dirck-van-baburen/the-lute-player-1622][i]The Lute Player[/i][/url] (1622) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dirck-van-baburen]Dirck van Baburen[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hendrick-terbrugghen/the-singing-lute-player-1624][i]A Man playing Lute[/i][/url] (1624) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hendrick-terbrugghen]Hendrick Terbrugghen[/url]. Hals, like many painters throughout Holland, emulated some of these models and gestures.\n\nThroughout his life, Hals painted both genre portraits and commissioned portraits, reserved for members of the upper classes. \u0421ommissioned portraiture conveyed the social status and prominence of its subjects. For this reason, Hals painted these two types of portraits in two different styles. This contrast is evident when comparing [i]Portrait of a Jester with a Lute[/i] to a commissioned portrait by Hals from the same period, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/portrait-of-jacob-pietersz-olycan][i]Portrait of Jacob Pietersz Olycan[/i][/url] (1625). In Olycan\u2019s commissioned portrait, Hals\u2019s brushwork is fine and smooth, and each detail is meticulously executed. The articles of Olycan\u2019s garment, such as the lace collar, are produced with special care and precision. But when painting the jester, Hals exhibited rougher and looser brushwork. In the garment, especially, red dabs of paint created the effect of a frill on the sleeve, while the bottom was constructed through blotches of red and gray paint. The painting reveals traces of the artist\u2019s brush, which gives it a vivid expressive quality. When Olycan\u2019s pose is serious and static, the portrait of the jester captures a fleeting moment of his spontaneous movement.\n\nThe Louvre acquired [i]Portrait of a Jester with a Lute[/i] in 1984. A copy of the painting, [i]The Jester[/i] (1625) is part of Rijksmuseum Museum collection in Amsterdam. At first, the copy was considered to be executed by Hals; later, it was established that one of his followers painted it. Most likely it was [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/judith-leyster]Judith Leyster[/url], a Dutch painter who might have been Hals\u2019s pupil in 1629, and later was married to painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-miense-molenaer]Jan Miense Molenaer[/url]. The copy is similar to the original in dimension, and it emulates the painting in its composition, handling of light, and the unrestrained brushwork. The painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/david-bailly]David Bailly[/url] also paid homage to Hals\u2019s painting in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/david-bailly/self-portrait-with-vanitas-symbols-1651][i]Self-portrait with Vanitas Symbols[/i][/url] (ca. 1651). In the self-portrait, the artist surrounds himself with objects that reflect his artistic identity and interests. A sketch of [i]Portrait of a Jester with a Lute[/i] is hanging in the background, featured as an object significant to Bailly."

        "description": "On 4 July 1932, Frida had a miscarriage in Detroit, after being under the supervision of her doctors, who recommended long periods of complete bed rest to bring her pregnancy to term. Her body, however, was unable to resist and she was finally taken to the Henry Ford Hospital, where an abortion was performed to finish the process that had begun at home.\nSome days later, in a state of deep depression, Frida asked to be brought the fetus of her child so that she could paint it. She was not granted her wish, having to make do with some illustrations provided by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Diego[/url] and her doctors, with which she began to create this work, named after the hospital in which she was cared for.\n\nMany of Kahlo's paintings from the early 1930s, especially in size, format, architectural setting, and spatial arrangement relate to religious [i]ex-voto[/i] paintings of which she and Rivera possessed a large collection ranging in the date over several centuries. [i]Ex-votos[/i] are made as a gesture of gratitude for salvation, a granted prayer or disaster averted and left in churches or at shrines. [i]Ex-votos[/i] are generally painted on small-scale metal panels and depict the incident along with the Virgin or saint to whom they are offered. [i]Henry Ford Hospital[/i] (1932) is a good example where the artist uses the [i]ex-voto[/i] format but subverts it by placing herself center stage, rather than recording the miraculous deeds of saints. Kahlo paints her own story, as though she becomes saintly and the work is made not as thanks to the lord but in defiance, questioning why he brings her pain. [i]Henry Ford Hospital[/i] is the first painting for which Frida used a metal sheet as a support, in the tradition of Mexican ex-votos, or votive tablets. She continued to use metal in her later works like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/my-birth-1932][i]My Birth[/i][/url] (1932), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-along-the-boarder-line-between-mexico-and-the-united-states-1932][i]Self-Portrait on the Border of Mexico and The United States[/i] [/url] (1932), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-necklace-1933][i]Self-Portrait with Necklace[/i][/url] (1933), etc.\n\nIn [i]Henry Ford Hospital[/i], Kahlo lies on a bed, bleeding after a miscarriage. From the exposed naked body six vein-like ribbons flow outwards, attached to symbols. One of these six objects is a fetus, suggesting that the ribbons could be a metaphor for umbilical cords. The other five objects that surround Frida are things that she remembers or things that she had seen in the hospital. For example, the snail makes reference to the time it took for the miscarriage to be over, whilst the flower was an actual physical object given to her by Diego. The artist demonstrates her need to be attached to all that surrounds her: to the mundane and metaphorical as much as the physical and actual. Perhaps it is through this reaching out of connectivity that the artist tries to be 'maternal', even though she is not able to have her own child. Tears pour from Frida\u2019s eyes. There is a view of the Ford Motor Company in the industrial city of Detroit on the horizon, where Rivera was painting some murals. \n\nFrida Kahlo produced a number of portraits with the subjects in bed. This includes [i]My Birth[/i] (1932), where she captures her own birth, complete with soiled sheets that tell the story of what has just happened. Beyond that, she used a bed in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/a-few-small-nips-passionately-in-love-1935][i]A Few Small Nips[/i][/url] (1935), based on newspaper accounts of a brutal murder, related to her feelings of being \u2018murdered by life\u2019. It was timed just as Frida became aware of her husband's misdemeanors, which left her emotionally broken. Sometime in the previous year, Rivera had embarked upon an affair with her younger sister Cristina, which wounded Kahlo deeply. Rivera later commented that the paintings Kahlo made in 1932 were \u2018much better than those she executed before losing her baby,\u2019 describing her as: \u2018The only artist in the history of art who tore open her chest and heart to reveal the biological truth of her feelings.\u2019 Her dramatic scenes of pain and anguish have successfully built a strong following of support, partly due to her consistent role as the woman who was talented but also taken advantage of. Modern society is growing in support for female rights and this has helped to make Frida Kahlo a true icon, almost a martyr for the mistreated gender."

Sometimes referred to as Group of Three Girls, the painting won the Gold Medal at the annual exhibition of the Bombay Art Society in 1937. The painting was part of a batch sent to Nawab Salar Jang of Hyderabad who later rejected them all.\r\n\r\nThe painting shows three colourfully dressed women contemplating a destiny they are unable to change. Amrita Sher-Gil did not sensualise her women but instead portrayed them as facing great adversity yet having the spirit to transcend a destiny that they were unable to change. Sher-Gil wrote: \"I realized my real artistic mission, to interpret the life of Indians and particularly the poor Indians pictorially; to paint those silent images of infinite submission and patience,... to reproduce on canvas the impression those sad eyes created on me.\"\r\n\r\nThe painting reflects the influence of the works of French painter Paul Gauguin on Sher-Gil's work. It also marks Sher-Gil's move from an earlier academic and realist style of painting that she had learned in Paris towards a flatter style with modern compositions, where line and colour are prominently used. In Three Girls, the girls' surrounding is not shown. Their situation is made evident through their facial expressions, their body language, and the skillful use of tones."

Patio in Capri appears to be particularly inspired by Shchedrin's Terrace on the Sea Coast of 1828, which similarly portrayed the idyllic Italy of the Russian imagination. Both compositions depict vine-wrapped terraces above the sea in a seemingly magical place where man and nature exist together inharmonious beauty. Like Shchedrin, Gorbatov implemented an innovative palette to better evoke the varying qualities of light found along the coast, meanwhile capturing a perfect moment in time, a quiet afternoon in Capri."

At the time he painted Gladiators, Guston was painting murals in New York as part of a Works Progress Administration (WPA) program.

Precisionist artists celebrated industrialization and technology with a visual language that evoked the purity and perfection of the machine. [Gallery label text, 2007]\r\n\r\nThe Whitestone Bridge, linking The Bronx and Queens, was opened in 1939 just in time for the New York World's Fair.  The suspension bridge routed travelers coming to the Fair from Upstate and New England away from the congestion of New York City.  At the same time, Crawford was moving away from painting traditional landscapes and searching for a vocabulary that was closer in spirit to the streamlined, industrial aesthetic that he was observing in the world around him.  The Whitestone Bridge was an excellent match for his artistic aspirations.\r\n\r\nThe sleek and futuristic lines of the Whitestone Bridge matched the Trylon and Perisphere logo of the World's Fair, which was intended to signify progress and the World of Tomorrow.  By 1944, when this painting was acquired by the Encyclopedia Britannica Collection, the sleek and elegant Whitestone Bridge had become an icon of contemporary design.\r\n\r\nThe curator traveled to New York City to determine whether the bridge really looks as though it extends back into space with no land visible on the other side.  And, in fact, Crawford's thrilling vantage point can be experienced by taking the bus across the bridge - for a brief instant, the first-time crosser experiences the view that Crawford recorded: a slim line of road, held up by wires, sailing across the water with no end in sight.

The painting portrays Battersea Bridge's pier in the foreground, while the tower of Chelsea Old Church and the newly built Albert Bridge can be seen in the distance. Fireworks appear as dots of color in the sky beyond the bridge. To create these works, Whistler traveled by boat along the river in the early evening, sketching as he went, relying on his memory and rough sketches to produce these thinly painted, atmospheric scenes of serene tranquility.\n\nWhistler's admiration for the Japanese aesthetic is evident in the painting's composition, which shares similarities with Katsushika Hokusai's Under the Mannen Bridge at Fukagawa, one of Whistler's favorite Ukiyo-e painters. The painting was produced in Whistler's libel suit against John Ruskin as evidence of the artist's successful rendering of an artful impression or memory of a fleeting moment. Whistler argued that the subject matter becomes irrelevant, and the relationship between color and form is of paramount importance.\n\nThe painting was titled \"nocturne\" after wealthy shipping magnate and patron Frederick Leyland described it as such. It features variations of blues with a golden tinge. Whistler's style of blurring forms and emphasizing subtle tonal differences makes his \"nocturnes\" among the earliest experiments in abstraction. These works intrigued his Impressionist friends, who were exploring the relationship between different colors, and influenced French composer Claude Debussy, who created an orchestral composition titled Three Nocturnes in 1899."

        "description": "Tintoretto's most remarkable work is the vast and complex series of fifty canvases painted between 1565 and 1587 for the meeting rooms of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco (a confraternity devoted to combating the plague, a repeated scourge of the Venice.) They illustrate scenes from the life of Christ and the Virgin in the upper and lower halls, respectively, and scenes from the Passion - dominated by this colossal [i]Crucifixion[/i] - in the Sala dell' Albergo. The [i]Crucifixion[/i] embodies several critical characteristics of Tintoretto's art. The teeming canvas, full of incident, also recalls several of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese]Veronese[/url]'s monumental works - indeed, the sheer scale of the canvases sometimes used by these artists required a wealth of detail to fill the large area. The canvas of the [i]Crucifixion[/i] took up an entire wall, and to help him create his intricate series of poses and compositions, Tintoretto made use of numerous small wax models, which he moved around and illuminated from different angles.\n\nIn conception and execution, Tintoretto's Christ on the cross is one of the most unusual and compelling scenes of the crucifixion of the 16th century. Instead of focusing on the individuals directly involved in the event, the artist provides us with a panoramic scene of Golgotha, populated by an astonishingly varied throng - including soldiers, executioners, horsemen, tradesmen, onlookers, thieves, and apostles - engaged in all sorts of different activities and movements with almost insect-like urgency. In the process, he explores every aspect of the scene. \n\nOne infrequent feature for Renaissance art is the inclusion of the two thieves in the composition, one being nailed to a cross, the other being raised. All four Gospels relate that two thieves were crucified with Christ. According to Luke, the one on Christ's right rebuked the other, saying that their punishment was deserved whereas Christ was innocent. Christ said to him, \"Today, you shall be with me in Paradise.\" The role of the thieves clearly gave Tintoretto a means of filling the vast canvas. But it is also true to say that all his paintings for the Scuola emphasized the humility and mercy of Christ, as well as his links with ordinary sinners, the poor, and the destitute, and the story of the thieves fits nicely into this theme.\n\nIn his thought-provoking article on Tintoretto's Crucifixion, published in \"Painters on Painting\" (1969), Brian Robb states that the man who is busily securing the second thief's cross is employing the same techniques and same type of tool (a gimlet) that he himself had observed being used by a Venetian carpenter constructing a jetty. This is not merely a curiosity - it underlines the extent to which Tintoretto's work drew on the life around him, not least the balance and lean and thrust of gondoliers, whose gestures undoubtedly inspired many of the figures' tenuous relation to gravity. In the foreground, on the right, is a man with his back to us, digging; perhaps he is preparing a hole for the stake of the cross, but more particularly, he serves as a striking example of the energy being expressed across the painting.\n\nThe raising of the crosses also afforded Tintoretto the opportunity of depicting numerous muscular individuals in vigorous motion, testifying to his interest in the figure drawing of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo]Michelangelo[/url], while it also enabled him to introduce two strong diagonals that bring dynamism to the scene and help to create a strong underlying structure. In particular, the diagonals focus attention on the figure of Christ, who is still and calm on his cross - a figure of calm amid the chaos and turmoil below. Under a clouded sky that somehow manages to be at the same time calm and apocalyptic, Christ's body is parallel to the picture-plane, reinforcing the impression of stillness, and he looks with special compassion upon the group at the foot of the cross, which includes the swooning Virgin and also his friends. The group is beautifully painted and brought together in a dignified and rhythmic movement.\n\nChrist is placed very high on the cross, almost at the top of the scene before us. The nails piercing His hands and feet are visible, but little is made of his suffering. The light radiating from Christ's head has physical substance, like wings, and though the head leans forward, it is not drooping with exhaustion but first looking down on the scene around him. Another feature of the scene that is distinctly Venetian is the introduction of vast numbers of people, most of them richly dressed, who have come to witness the event. Men in armor or luxurious clothes and exotic headgear crowd around from all directions, turning the episode into a spectacle (see also Veronese's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/the-marriage-at-cana-1563][i]Wedding Feast at Cana[/i][/url] (1563) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/feast-in-the-house-of-levi-1573][i]Feast in the House of Levi[/i][/url] (1573) for later versions of this 'spectacle' effect.) It is a painting that involves the spectator in the highest degree, especially as details such as the ladder on the left are so close to the picture-plane and the viewer's space. Although the Renaissance color palette is limited, the dusky setting, out of which emerges a pattern of brilliant reds and whites, is reminiscent of some of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]'s early works and is almost certainly designed to take account of the lighting of the room. After Tintoretto's death, Venice had to wait for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-battista-tiepolo]Giambattista Tiepolo[/url] before it had a master of such stature again."

The 1938 version is considered to be the last work created by Rubens, as at this time he was ill with gout, which led to his death in 1640. As a model for the women figures, he used his young bride, who in 1630 married the then-16 year old girl, and who often served as his idealized version of the female body. The painting was commissioned by the brother of the Spanish King, Philip IV. After his brother\u2019s death, the king declared the painting immodest, and ordered it to be burned.

Her first sustained pictorial efforts were, perhaps as a result, undertaken not with paint but with yarn. Even after Moses gave up making these embroidered \"worsted\" pictures, she tended to treat paint like yarn.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most salient aspects of working with yarn is that\u2014 unlike paint\u2014yarn makes it impossible to blend colors. In order to achieve subtle gradations of hue, multicolored strands must be placed side by side. This way of working translated into what some have characterized as Moses' impressionistic handling of paint. In Hoosick Valley (From the Window), varied tones of green and yellow are set next to one another to evoke the interplay between parched meadows and verdant hills.\r\n\r\nMoses also used paint texture in a manner that mimicked embroidery. Fenceposts are \"stitched\" into place, blossoming trees appear to be rendered in little knots of thread. Moses established a series of textural gradations, from flat expanses and isolated blocks of color to more intricate, multicolored configurations. Certain details were deliberately executed in raised paint in order to set them off from the background. Many of Moses' paintings, when viewed up close, are actually composites of abstract forms."

Several of these lines meet at a point one quarter of the way up the righthand edge, others half way up the lefthand side. The lines represent the division of the gardens and serve as compositional aids. The river border of the gardens is marked by a line running from a quarter of the way up the lefthand side to the middle of the righthand edge. The trees are also arranged geometrically. The trunk of the tree on the far left marks a line bisecting the centre of the top edge. The next tree denotes the golden section of the width of the painting, the third is exactly mid-way.\r\nThis precise composition is inscribed in pencil or charcoal on a painted white ground. The bushes have been drawn in charcoal, or possibly cont\u00e9 crayon, and rubbed into the ground to achieve the smudged effect visible through the coloured dots. The trees are rendered in tones of red-brown. In contrast to these pointillist and linear forms, the sky is painted with smooth modulations of white, pale blue and pink.\r\nDuring the war, Pasmore had studied many of the Post-Impressionists' writings, and in the following years he worked through some of their ideas in his own paintings. The impact of Seurat's Pointillism is particularly evident here."

Until now it was thought that the first painter to use clouds in this way was Andrea Mantegna, with a painting of St Sebastian from 1460, in which high up in the sky there's a cloud from which a knight on horseback emerges. Now we know that Giotto was the first to use this technique. The master may have painted it to spite someone he knew by portraying him as a devil in the painting. "

        "description": "Begun in 1903 according to what is documented by a letter from Pellizza to Morbelli, the painting was finished in 1904 and was presented in Munich in 1905. The sun as a regenerating force and symbolic form of nature has been a subject that has long been meditated upon in various preparatory studies. between 1903 and 1905 (The rising of the sun, Ricci collection, Turin. The sun, Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna, Milan. The sun, private collection, Turin). The title originally given by the artist was \"Rising Sun\", and Pellizza explained how it had to be part of the \"Glorifications\": as the ancients glorified gods and saints, \"we will glorify Nature in its most grandiose spectacles, [...] the rising sun fascinates and dazzles all of nature, submitting it to its influence \".\n\n(source: ICCD - Central Institute for Catalog and Documentation, Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities)\n\nWriting to his friend Occhini in April 1903, Pellizza outlined the theme of this painting for the first time, specifying that he wanted to choose \"eternal subjects\", and therefore that he wanted to treat \"the beautiful nature that absorbs man and annihilates him in order to camp itself out blazing with its immortal beauty ... You must have already guessed my theme ...\" \n\n(Minutari 1903, f. 6, partially transcribed in the Catalog of Giuseppe Pellizza's Manuscripts from the Pellizza heirs donation, Tortona 1974, p. 105)\n\n\nThe intense desire to translate nature's most exciting spectacles onto canvas drove him to climb, even in the middle of the night, the surrounding hills and reach beyond Monleale to Cenelli in the Brada region, to wait, ready in front of his easel, for the dazzling appearance of the sun. As he wrote to Matteo Olivero, he sought to represent nature in its most magnificent spectacles, aiming, rather than to transcend it, to capture its essence with extreme scientific and philosophical rigour. The scientific rigour derived from the desire to translate light with the sum of the colours that compose it according to the analyses of physical science: Divisionist painting had set as one of its hinges of interest and research precisely the achievement of maximum luminosity and Pellizza, an apostle of this technique for more than ten years, felt ready to use it with extreme confidence and mastery. The philosophical rigour was a consequence of the examination of the problems linked to existence that Pellizza had always carried out in conjunction with his painting activity and that had pushed him to move from the external reproduction of reality to the search for the primary values of physical and social existence. The life-giving moment, the passage from darkness to light, was the nodal point of the entire natural world, and painting, after capturing the manifestation of light in objects, had to capture this life-giving moment.\nThe sun thus appears on the line of the hills with its spherical image coinciding with the maximum white and from which it radiates a dense sequence of strokes that gradually lengthen towards the edges of the canvas, passing from yellow to orange, to violet and green. The glow does not eliminate but rather absorbs and veils the perception of the surrounding nature, of the wide valley in the foreground with its trees and farmsteads whose essential forms can be glimpsed. The critics generally appreciated the work when it was exhibited in Milan at the exhibition celebrating the Simplon tunnel in 1906, held in the Castello Sforzesco, although not everyone grasped the abstract and symbolic value of Pellizzi's vision. For example, the critic of the Bolognese newspaper \"L'Avvenire d'Italia\", Endymion, underlined that Pellizza had happily overcome with divisionism a pictorial difficulty, previously considered insuperable, that of painting the solar disk, but to conclude that, although the illusion was great, the painting remained of a sterile verism. Ojetti, on the other hand, in the columns of the \"Corriere della Sera\", stressed that Pellizza \"achieves, with his diligent pointillism, a truly astonishing optical effect. But this effect would not be enough to justify the admiration for his work if he did not add to that dazzle in the shady meadows, under the slanting rays of the falling sun (sic! ), such an accurate study of the \"values\" that everything in his painting comes alive and emanates almost a sweet sadness suffused on the world with that trembling veil of light\"; the appreciation therefore extended to the stylistic reading of the whole work in its values and luminous relationships, which we still appreciate today, but which must have been difficult to read even for some careful contemporaries. Pantini himself remarked that the cut of the painting was modest, even though he had shown his appreciation of the rising sun, which appeared to him to be a real \"gleam, which for a long time makes your eyes really blink\". Similarly, P. De Luca noted the very effective sun coming up, which \"leaves, like the real thing, almost an impression in the pupil\". Very few tried to go beyond the perceptive value of the work, even if they did not clearly pose the question of symbolism.\nThis was done in passing by Primo Levi \"l'Italico\" (1853-1917) who noted in the \"Tribuna\": \"One must finally turn to Pellizza da Volpedo to feel illuminated by a sun that truly seems to be the sun of the future\": with this sentence, referring to one of the elements of the iconography linked to the workers' and socialist parties, he grasped that profound sense of regeneration and rebirth of all things that Pellizza had aimed for in reproducing the moment of nature's maximum splendour, making the rising sun, the dawn of a new day, also the dawn of a new century that would be able to know more deeply the mysteries and essence of the universe. The naturalistic motif of the rising sun thus profoundly embodies Pellizza's Symbolist desire.\n\n\nWriting to Olivero in October 1904, Pellizza in fact remarked:\n\n\"The works that I keep in the studio are of two categories: concept and landscape - the first \"The Bridge\", \"Rising Sun\", \"Love in Life\" are \"Glorifications\" in that I want to present the things represented in their most solemn, most typical and best being\", \n\nthus also clearly differentiating The Sun from a material reproduction of reality, from a pure landscape. At the Milan exhibition of 1906, the work was bought by the Ministry for the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome at the price of 2,500 lire. It was the first purchase of Pellizza's works for a public museum: Milan belatedly did justice to the painter who, not undeservedly, had begun to hope for a state purchase as early as 1894 at the Esposizioni Riunite at Castello Sforzesco, with 'On the barn'."

        "description": "Roman Capriccio: The Pantheon and Other Monuments is a 1735 oil painting by Italian artist Giovanni Paolo Panini, located in the Indianapolis Museum of Art, which is in Indianapolis, Indiana. It depicts an array of famous Roman monuments in a rural setting. Panini was a famed painter of capriccios, architectural fantasies. In this case, he combined a staggering array of monuments by Romans without regard to topography. From left to right, he included the Temple of Hadrian, the Pantheon, the Temple of Vesta, the Maison Carr\u00e9e, and the Theater of Marcellus, all of them surrounding the Obelisk of Thutmose III. In front of this overabundance of history, he placed the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, around which contemporary Roman peasants carry out their business. While quite cavalier with regards to geography, Panini was remarkably faithful in his architectural reconstructions. He carefully edited out later additions to the original buildings, such as the walled-in sections in the arches of the Theater of Marcellus and Bernini's bell towers on the Pantheon's pediment.\r\n\r\nPanini's earliest training was with a painter of theatrical scenery, and certain elements of that early influence can be seen in this painting. The arrangement of monuments is very similar to the way architectural perspective was achieved in the Italian theater. At the front of the \"stage\" are the peasant-actors in quaint costumes. Fashionable European youths undertook the Grand Tour throughout the eighteenth century, and for half a century to either side, and liked to bring back souvenirs of their travels. Thus, sketches and paintings of landmarks such as those in the Capriccio were very lucrative for Panini and his contemporaries. Escapism and contemplation were more important than geographical accuracy, so Panini was free to rearrange scenery in paintings like this. This creative reorganization led to a better comprehension of the ideal, rather than current, conditions of the monuments and the civilization that made them.\r\n\r\nThe IMA received Roman Capriccio: The Pantheon and Other Monuments and its pendant, The Colosseum and Other Monuments in 1950, as gifts of Lila Allison Lilly in memory of her husband, Josiah Kirby Lilly. Both are currently on view in the Jane H. Fortune Gallery. It has the accession number 50.5."

        "description": "An early example of John Currin\u2019s renowned figurative practice, [i]Young Man[/i] imbues its subject with a sense of enigmatic poise. Classically composed, highly stylised and painted in the manner of traditional portraiture, Currin\u2019s figure is centrally placed, carefully modeled through light and shade against a baize-like background. Operating at a time when the contemporary art world had declared painting dead, Currin cultivated an ability to destabilise through a language of ostensibly well-established tropes. Indeed, as we contemplate the young man himself, we realise that this is far from an exercise in pastiche. In his effeminate, almost androgynous appearance, Currin\u2019s subject is a fundamentally postmodern protagonist, charged with an ambiguity that offsets the artist\u2019s anachronistic painterly vocabulary. In disturbing the relationship between form and content, Currin\u2019s beguiling figure draws the viewer into a dialogue in which we are continually prompted to question our assumptions.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Currin developed a pictorial style geared towards questioning social norms, as well as challenging artistic trends towards self-critical irony. Building a rich repertoire of characters inspired by societal roles, Currin\u2019s practice employs traditional painterly techniques whilst drawing on aspects of contemporary visual culture in a manner similar to Francis Picabia, an artist he greatly admired. Yet within Currin\u2019s ever-expanding line-up of social types \u2013 from schoolgirls to domesticated husbands to middle-aged socialite women \u2013 the present work occupies a poignant position. Exuding an aura of self-reflection and humility, [i]Young Man[/i] is not a hard-lined stereotype; instead, the artist is at pains to capture the unique essence of his imagined subject, imbuing the work with a sense of expressive depth and formal elegance. A contemporary embodiment of classical aesthetics within an increasingly diverse social and artistic landscape, [i]Young Man[/i] possesses a quiet dignity that repeatedly arrests the viewer\u2019s gaze."

Struggling to find recognition and success in Paris, Gauguin decided to move permanently to Tahiti in 1895. There he continued to struggle: plagued by illness and mounting debt, his mental health rapidly deteriorated. Around the same time, he learned that his beloved daughter Aline died of pneumonia. At this low point, he summoned his strength to paint [i]Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?[/i], a masterpiece that was a summation of his artistic ideas. He wrote: \u201cI have put all my energy into it one more time before I die, so painful a passion in such dreadful circumstances, so clear and accurate a vision, that there is no trace of precociousness and life blossoms forth from it\u201d.\n\nThe painting, which should be viewed from right to left, represents the spectrum of human activity throughout one\u2019s life, from birth to death. The thread of the composition corresponds with the questions posed in the title of the painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? The boundaries of the scene are marked by the newborn child lying in the grass on the right, and the haggard old woman, who glumly reflects on the past. Between these two, Gauguin creates a dreamlike vision that describes the daily existence of adulthood. In the background, he included a couple walking and an exotic blue idol, which, according to Gauguin, symbolized \u2018the Beyond'. The large canvas features some of Gauguin\u2019s favorite subjects, such as the reclining nude, the group of figures lost in thought, and the cult statue.\n\nThe painting expressed Gauguin\u2019s highly personal mythology, which was developed through the combination and adaption of symbols from a variety of Western and non-Western sources. In particular, the scene reflects the influence of Tahiti, its tropical landscape, and native Polynesian culture. Gauguin wanted the painting to evoke associative meanings, rather than explain explicitly the meaning of his symbolism. His symbolism expressed the inner world of visions and emotions, which was purposefully enigmatic and ambiguous. Gauguin wanted to interpret life as a great mystery, and in the painting, he emphasized the lack of understanding of the world.\n\nAfter he completed the painting, Gauguin sent it to Paris to the art collector George-Daniel de Monfreid. Shortly after the artist retreated to the hills where he intended to poison himself by drinking arsenic. Gauguin\u2019s suicide attempt failed, and he gradually recovered in the hospital. In the meantime, Monfried managed to sell the painting for a thousand francs, something that helped Gauguin\u2019s spirits. Today the painting is part of the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston."

The French government bought the painting in 1831, with plans to hang it in the room of the new king Louis-Philippe, but it was soon taken down for its revolutionary content.

Her hands are blue and red, covered with something that could easily be identified as blood. The upper part of the body is bluish while the rest is yellow to white; the face is even paler. The feet are not finished but broadly sketched. The girl seems angry as she stares petulantly toward the viewer. Her nudity gives her a barbarous air, and she has been sometimes described as \"an evil force of destruction.\"\n\nThe striking portrait is based on a snapshot of Dumas' own daughter, Helena, who was finger painting on a hot summer day. By taking her entirely out of her original context, Dumas deceives the viewer and makes him/her look at her child in a very distinctive way. The artist herself, talking about this work, commented on the ambiguity of childhood with its cruelty and naivet\u00e9. A parallel can be drawn with Diane Arbus' famous photograph Child with a toy hand grenade in Central Park, NYC (1962). In it, the little boy also seems angry and threatening as he holds a grenade in his hand, yet he was merely growing impatient with the photographer and only wanted to return to his toys. This contrast between violence and innocence would mark much of Dumas' work.\n\nThe generalizing title of \"The Painter\" adds another layer to consider. The menacing little girl suddenly becomes a powerful force of creation. She becomes the artist, the source, and the genius. Dumas plays with the iconic, romantic representation of a painter with a bit of humor. At the same time, she pays homage to her daughter - a mother's source of everything from life and death, fear and glory, happiness and sadness. Dumas powerfully and emotionally paints love and motherhood through the image of an angry and fearful monster-like little girl. Helena has commented about this work that it is one of the best paintings her mother has ever done."

The title suggests that industrialization is a pinnacle of American achievement equivalent to the great monuments of the ancient world, evoking the pyramids of Egypt and their symbolic association with life after death, which may have been a compelling idea to Demuth, who was bedridden by illness at numerous points throughout his life. At the same time, the painting may also allude to the slave labor that built the great monuments to the pharaohs. Thus serving as a critique of the dehumanizing effect of industry on American workers.\n\nThis work is one of Demuth\u2019s most famous paintings and is understood to be a psychological self-portrait of the artist."

She says that taken as a pair, Waterhouse's Circes prompt the question: \"is she goddess or woman?\"[3]\nCirce Invidiosa is part of the collection of the Art Gallery of South Australia, which also owns Waterhouse's The Favourites of the Emperor Honorius.[4]"

The General lies dying, surrounded by two groups of soldiers and the Union Jack flag, evoking a Christ-like image at the center of the composition. The formal arrangement is reminiscent of traditional religious scenes like The Lamentation or The Descent from the Cross. Instead of apostles, high-ranking friends of Wolfe, one of whom unrealistically wipes the General's bloodless chest with a white cloth, are present in the foreground. Although designated as a history painting, only one of the identifiable men - flag bearer Lieutenant Brown - was actually present at Wolfe's death. A Native American warrior in traditional dress kneels in the foreground, embodying both Romantic ideals of the \"noble savage\" and reminding English viewers of Native American and colonial aid during the war.\n\nThe muted, less-defined background provides theatrical depth while focusing the viewer's attention on the scene. The British fleet on the St. Lawrence River is visible in the distance, and smoke from gunfire creates a dramatic cloudscape. As the smoke clears on the left, a cathedral spire and blue sky appear, symbolizing hope.\n\nThe work is considered a \"blockbuster\" due to its narrative abundance and a \"breakthrough\" in formal innovations. At the time, history paintings did not depict current events, and heroes did not wear contemporary dress. West went against professional advice from Joshua Reynolds, arguing that the same truth that guides the historian should govern the artist's pencil. Despite his rebellion, the piece was successful with the public, and William Woollett's engraving found a broad commercial audience. West painted five more versions, one of which King George III hung in his private collection. The Death of General Wolfe revolutionized history painting and influenced painters such as John Trumbull and John Singleton Copley. According to art historian Loyd Grossman, it is one of the first great modern pieces if modernity is understood as the will to \"heroize\" the present, in Michel Foucault's words."

This work - a substitute for one by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] - was one of three provided by Titian between 1518 and 1525. The other two are [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/the-worship-of-venus-1518][i]Worship of Venus[/i][/url] (1518-1519) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/bacchanal-1524][i]Bacchanal of the Andrians[/i][/url] (1523-1525), both now in the Prado Museum, Madrid.\n\nDerived from stories by the Roman poets Ovid and Catullus, this picture portrays the first encounter between Bacchus (god of wine), and Ariadne (daughter of King Minos), on the island of Naxos. Despite her vital role in helping Theseus to defeat the minotaur, Ariadne has been deserted by her lover, whose ship can be seen (far left of the picture) sailing away into the distance. As she watches the ship depart, her sorrow is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Bacchus and his unruly troupe of drunken friends, one of whom (a satyr) is waving aloft the head of an animal they have just killed (its head is lying on the ground). When the startled Ariadne turns to face the revelers, she sees Bacchus leaping from his chariot and their eyes meet: it is love at first sight. Bacchus leaps down from his chariot, drawn by two cheetahs, and declares his love. He promises to be a more faithful partner than Theseus and offers her a constellation of stars (Corona Borealis, the Northern Crown) as a wedding gift. Other versions have Bacchus raising her to heaven and transforming her into a constellation, represented by the eight stars above her.\n\nTitian manages to extract the maximum amount of drama out of the story, mainly through the dynamic postures adopted by his two main actors. But equally important are their swirling draperies with their luminous blue and rose tones - Titian's two favorite colors. At any rate, the composition is filled with movement and color, as semi-naked figures writhe and cavort in poses taken from Greek sculpture of classical antiquity, such as the satyr who is struggling with snakes in a similar fashion to that shown in the Greek statue [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-greek-painting/laocoon-and-his-sons--125][i]Laocoon and His Sons[/i][/url] (c.125 BC).

Completed during Xu's stay in Singapore, the painting was exhibited numerous times before its disappearance from public view in 1954. It re-emerged in 2007 and was sold for HK$72 million (US$9.2 million) in an auction on 7 April 2007 in Hong Kong, then setting a record for the highest price ever paid for a Chinese painting at an auction.\r\n\r\nIn October 1939, during his stay in Singapore, Xu Beihong was inspired by a street drama performance titled Put Down Your Whip by actress Wang Ying, a friend of Xu's. Written by Tian Han, the drama depicts a girl and her father who escaped from the Japanese-occupied northeastern China and performed in the streets for a living. They sang about the hardship under the Japanese Occupation and inspired their listeners to support the anti-Japanese war. Deeply moved by the drama, Xu spent ten days painting a life-size portrait of Wang with her audience in the background. He then titled the painting Put Down Your Whip after the drama.\r\n\r\nThe painting was exhibited on numerous occasions during Xu's life. However, it disappeared from public view in 1954, a year after Xu's death. According to Sotheby's Asia chairman Patti Wong, Xu gave the painting to a close friend named Huang Menggui. After Huang died, his descendants approached the National Museum of Singapore in the hope that the museum could take the painting into its collection, but it did not happen for unspecified reasons. Huang's descendants then approached Singaporean collector Tan Tsze Chor, but Tan died abruptly, before the deal was made. The painting eventually landed in the hands of an anonymous Asian collector, until being put up for auction in 2007. Put Down Your Whip was sold on 7 April 2007 in an auction in Hong Kong by Sotheby's for HK$72 million (US$9.2 million), setting a record for the highest price ever paid for a Chinese painting at an auction. The painting was bought by an anonymous collector over the telephone after competition from at least four other bidders. In response to the auction, some art historians have criticized the explosion in the prices for Asian art, in particular over exuberant buyers for sending prices sky-high. Sotheby's Asia chairman Patti Wong, however, responded stating Xu's Put Down Your Whip would have sold well in any market."

This is the first painting bearing the signature \"Kamal-ol-Molk\". \"The Mirror Hall\" was in fact more of a turning-point in Iran's art than a mere painting; a window to a new world rather than paint on canvas. \n\nThis exquisite painting is indicative of Kamal-ol-Molk's talent and creativity. In this work, the artist marvellously depicts all the delicacy and details of the vast \"Mirror Hall\" of Golestan Palace. In this lively spirited painting, Nasereddin Shah is portrayed sitting in the middle of \"The Mirror Hall\". The reflection of light and the shadow of the objects in the Hall in hundreds of pieces of mirror as well as the reflection of mirrors in one another are so delicately pictured that the beholder can do nothing but stand and wonder. \n\nDuring a period of about six years (1885-1890), he used all his creativity, stamina and talent to create the painting. A critic once said of the Mirror Hall:\n\"The delicate struvture of the painting resembles a miniature. Massive chandeliers, crystal prisms, begemmed chairs and tables, a carpet rich in designs, long wavy tulle curtains, tree boughs learning against the window as if whispering the wind's song into the Hall's ears are all reflected in the pieces of mirror, small and large, on the walls and ceiling. The golden rays of the sun have slipped on the magnificent carpet. Light and shadow are harmoniously mingled together to create a scene that mesmerizes the spectator\".\n\nThe Mirror Hall is the most famous of the halls of the Golestan Palace. This relatively small hall is famous for its extraordinary mirror work. The hall was designed by Haj Abd ol Hossein Memar Bashi (Sanie ol Molk). Yahya Khan (Mowtamed ol Molk), who was the Minister of Architecture, was a consultant for the designer."

Bentinck sat to Romney in October and November 1787 and June 1788. The artist was an important portrait painter of the late eighteenth century, generally ranked third after Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. He was in Paris in 1764 and in 1773 moved to Italy for two years, where he became interested in history paintings in the elevated and \u00e9litist 'Grand Manner'. This developed into improving upon nature and the pursuit of perfect form. At its best his work demonstrated refinement, sensitivity and elegance, although it could also be repetitive and monotonous. As a society painter he typified late-eighteenth-century English artists who, compelled by the conditions of patronage to spend their time in producing portraits, could only aspire to imaginative and ideal painting. By 1780 Romney's portraits, according to Horace Walpole, were 'in great vogue' and he worked in an increasingly neo-classical style. See also BHC2550 for a portrait of Bentinck as a child, with his father."

        "description": "In December 1577, a fire broke out on the ground floor of the Doge's Palace in Venice, resulting in serious damage to the decoration, walls, ceilings, and furnishings of various rooms and significantly affecting the structure of the building. So great was the damage that the idea of demolishing the old [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/gothic-art]Gothic[/url] building and replacing it with a new one was seriously considered. After considerable discussion, it was, however, decided to restore the areas affected and to replace the interior decoration. Among the damaged rooms was one of the most celebrated: the Sala del Maggior Consiglio. This large space, whose proportions make it one of the most majestic and imposing in the entire building, was the room where the Great Council met. In the 16th century, the Venetian senators who formed the Council numbered more than 1, 000. The room was used for purposes of legislation and for electing members of the magistracy.\n\nIt was decided to restore the room with a flat ceiling divided into sections with decorative, high-relief molding into which paintings would be fitted. The same concept was to be used for the frieze that ran along the two long side walls of the room in which painted portraits of the Doges would be inset. The subject selected to decorate the walls of the room was the Glorification of Venice, depicted through a series of military episodes. Three huge canvases would provide the principal elements in the ceiling. They are a central, rectangular one by Jacopo Tintoretto, depicting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tintoretto/doge-nicol%C3%B2-da-ponte-receiving-a-laurel-crown-from-venice-1584][i]The City of Venice offering a laurel Wreath to Doge Nicol\u00f2 da Ponte[/i][/url] (1584) and two flanking, oval ones in which [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese]Veronese[/url] painted an [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/apotheosis-of-venice-1585][i]Allegory of Venice[/i][/url] (1585), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/palma-il-giovane]Palma Giovane[/url] depicted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/palma-il-giovane/venice-crowned-by-victory-1584][i]Venice, crowned by Victory, receiving the conquered Provinces[/i][/url] (1584).\n\nTo replace the medieval fresco of around 1365 by Guariento, which had been damaged in the fire, the commission entrusted with devising and overseeing the new decoration organized a competition that may have been convened in 1582. The theme of this new image was the \"Glory of the blessed in Paradise.\" Among the painters who took part were Francesco Bassano, Veronese, Palma Giovane, and Tintoretto. The commission gave the project to Veronese and Francesco Bassano, two artists with widely differing styles. However, Veronese's death in 1588 and the fact that Bassano had not started his part by the time of Veronese's death resulted in the project being given to Tintoretto, who was seventy years old by this date.\n\nAccording to the guidelines established for the competition, the composition had to focus on the Coronation of the Virgin, inspired by Dante's [i]Paradise[/i]. Tintoretto included the blessed and different religious hierarchies among clouds, angels, and cherubim. The principal motif is the Coronation of the Virgin in the upper center, while the Dove of the Holy Spirit forms the axis of this complex composition. The main group, in which Christ leans forward and extends his hand to crown his mother, emerges between numerous heads and figures against the intense yellow of a cloud of glory. The remaining figures in the canvas are arranged in gently curving lines, floating among clouds and stars. Tintoretto has woven in the traditional iconography of the Annunciation scene, where the angel Gabriel announces that Mary will carry the child of God, together with the Last Judgment, implied by the artist with the symbol of the scales. The clouds wrap around the central figures, almost likes ripples in a pond, suggesting the continued reverberations of the church's teachings - especially significant during the time of the Counter-Reformation.\n\nSeen from afar, [i]Paradiso[/i] is nearly an abstract vision composed of rhythmic patterns of light and color. The work represents the culmination of the artist's mastery of sharp contrasts between light and dark in the intensely rendered figures. The dramatic, almost theatrical quality of Tintoretto's scene would lay the foundation for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] art."

        "description": "In 1891, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] artist Paul Gauguin left France to travel to the island of Tahiti. For Gauguin, the tropical island held the promise of a \u2018primitive paradise\u2019, that was free from the constraints of modern society. However, once he arrived, Gauguin realized that the place he envisioned did not exist: the island was dealing with the impacts of colonialism and modernity, and native customs and culture seemed to be headed towards extinction. In his art, he tried to reimagine this lost paradise and experience the native Polynesian culture and customs.\n\n[i]Spirit of the Dead Watching (Mana\u00f2 Tupapa\u00fa)[/i] (1892) was one of the artist\u2019s best-known works from his[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Period_1st-tahiti-period,resultType:masonry] first visit to Tahiti[/url]. The painting depicts a young Tahitian girl haunted by the Tupapa\u00fa, the Polynesian spirit of the dead. The girl in the painting was Teha\u2019amana, Gauguin\u2019s young lover, and \u2018native-wife\u2019. In his Tahiti journals [i]Noa Noa[/i], he described the incident that inspired the painting: \u201cOne day I had to go to Papeete\u2026 I had promised to return that very evening\u2026  It was one in the morning by the time I arrived\u2026 The lamp had gone out and when I came home the bedroom was dark. I felt a sort of fear\u2026 I struck some matches and saw [what I pictured in my painting Mana\u00f2] Tupapa\u00fa.\u201d Frightened by the spirits, Teha\u2019amana lies naked on her stomach rigid and tense while glancing sideways toward the viewer.\n\nIn [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] Gauguin wanted to represent the Polynesian fear of the Tupapa\u00fa, who is depicted as an older woman wearing a black cloak. On the back wall, there are several white forms, that Gauguin described as phosphorescent lights, which symbolize the spirits that haunt the living. Gauguin depicted the figure of the Tupapa\u00fa in a similar fashion in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/words-of-the-devil-1892][i]Parau na te Varua ino (Words of the Devil)[/i][/url] (1892). In both cases, the artist juxtaposed the fearful nude figure with the Tupapa\u00fa: the Tupapa\u00fa is painted in cool tones that contrast the warm shades of the female nudes.\n\nThe painting also closely relates to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863][i]Olympia[/i][/url] (1863) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]\u00c9douard Manet[/url], a painting Gauguin greatly admired and even took a photograph of it with him to Tahiti. In the same way that Manet\u2019s [i]Olympia[/i] represented a modern incarnation of Venus, Gauguin wanted to showcase his version of a native Venus. This connection was also established by Gauguin\u2019s European contemporaries, the French writer Alfred Jarry called her \u2018a brown Olympia\u2019. [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] was important to Gauguin, he made several versions of the motif in drawings and woodblocks and even featured it in the background of the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/self-portrait-in-a-hat][i]Self-portrait in a Hat[/i][/url] (1893).\n\nAs new discourses developed, Gauguin\u2019s [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] prompted new readings and interpretations. Gauguin described his relationship with then thirteen-year-old Teha\u2019amana through the contrasts of youth and old age, of light and darkness and life and death. Given the fact that Gauguin was an older man in the position of taking advantage of his subject, the story behind [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] can take on a different meaning. Did the spirits cause Teha\u2019amana uneasiness or was she frightened by someone she sees beyond the picture plane? "

The picture was based on the earlier work [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione/the-sleeping-venus-1510][i]The Sleeping Venus[/i][/url] (1510) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione]Giorgione[/url], a close friend of the artist, although Titian's interpretation of the goddess is much more erotic. This sensuality is heightened by the directness of the nude's gaze, her faint smile, and her awareness of the viewer, along with the depiction of her in an opulent domestic environment without the allegorical or mythological symbols traditionally associated with Venus. While Giorgione's nude is idealized and demure, Titian's is realistic and tempting. The warm, light tones of her skin are in contrast to the darker, more affluent background, and the play of light on her body and subtle use of [i]chiaroscuro[/i] gives a sculptural quality to the nude. Her curves also contrast with the regularity of architectural elements, including the tiled floor, classical column, and green hanging, which bisects the scene, highlighting the fertile center of the figure.\n\nTitian's exceptional talent, his bold depiction of female sensuality, and his status as the leading Venetian painter of the Cinquecento is why this picture is often cited as the origin of many of Western art's most controversial images - including, for instance, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/nude-maja-1800][i]The Nude Maja[/i][/url] (c.1797) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya]Goya[/url], as well as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863][i]Olympia[/i][/url] (1863) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Edouard Manet[/url] - and is considered to be the original precursor to the pin-up.\n\nTitian painted this picture for the Duke of Camerino Guidobaldo della Rovere, who later became the Duke of Urbino, possibly to celebrate his marriage to Giuliana Varano. Despite her erotic air, Titian's Venus is no courtesan, and the painting is not a subtle promotion of casual infidelity. On the contrary, given that it was painted to commemorate Guidobaldo's marriage, it is almost certainly celebrating marital love and the physical intimacy between man and wife, a supposition supported by a number of details. In her right hand, for instance, the girl holds a posy of roses, which usually symbolize love; also, the sleeping dog is a common symbol of fidelity; lastly, the maids in the background are depicted rummaging in a traditional [i]cassone[/i], where wives commonly stored their [i]trousseaux[/i]. Perhaps the picture was conceived as an ideal model of behavior for Giuliana, the Duke's young bride. It was certainly not uncommon for pictures of an explicitly erotic nature to be commissioned to celebrate a wedding, although they would be intended for private viewing only.\n\n[i]The Venus of Urbino[/i] is full of artistic devices. To begin with, Titian achieves a beautiful contrast between the voluptuous curves of the girl's body and the vertical and horizontal lines of the dividing screen, floor tiles, and other architectural elements. The play of light on the girl's body and Titian's delicate [i]chiaroscuro[/i] lends a sculptural quality to her figure and also enhances the silky drapery of the bedsheets. The floor tiles provide an extra linear perspective, while the floral patterns of the couch, [i]cassoni[/i], and background tapestry - in conjunction with the rich color pigments of the screen and the maid's costume - help to unify and activate the composition.\n\nBy the time he executed this work, Titian was established as the leading master of Renaissance art in Venice. Above all, he was known for his remarkable use of color, and his works - which spanned all the major genres, including church altarpieces, mythological painting, portrait art, and pastoral landscape - were increasingly sought after by members of Italian Royal Houses. He went on to become recognized as a genius in his own time and has since been revered by such Old Masters as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Van Dyck[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Poussin[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens]Rubens[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez]Velazquez[/url]. In many subjects and painting genres, he set patterns that were copied by generations of painters, especially in portraiture. Unfortunately, his talent as an artist was not matched by his generosity of spirit: he became notorious for his greed and miserliness."

This canvas is one of Puvis's most well-known works and offers a glimpse into his personal psychology, displaying a private mood that is rarely shown in his large-scale paintings. The painting was developed over several years through sketches and painted studies and executed during a personally challenging time for the artist.\n\nAfter the success of his first murals in Paris in 1878, Puvis was anxious about his future prospects and the amount of artistic freedom he would have. When he showed this work at the Salon of 1881, Puvis indicated that he wanted it to be regarded in \"human, natural terms,\" with no religious, mystical, or philosophical symbolism. In European art, paintings of fishing often had Christian overtones, and Puvis had created such pictures before (such as Miraculous Draught of Fishes and The Fisherman). By insisting that there was no such symbolism in this work, Puvis introduced an element of realism without losing the attention of an audience accustomed to viewing religious subjects.\n\nPuvis had reservations about showing this work at the Salon of 1881, as it departed considerably in both subject matter and style from his earlier triumphs. Conservative critics criticized it, taking issue with the lack of traditional proportion and shading. However, it won him the respect of a new group of admirers, including Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, who championed the work and referenced it in later writing. Maurice Denis specifically admired the work and called for a new type of painting in his publication \"Definition of Neo-Traditionalism.\" Interestingly, Aristide Maillol executed a direct copy of this work, despite being a sculptor, printmaker, and sculptor-painter."

The vertical development of the image shows a young man climbing on a roof, intending to install the TV antenna at the house of a man far older than himself. The boy wears a baseball cap, holds the screwdriver in one hand, and stands astride the pointed roof, with the antenna cables rolled up to his chest and his mouth open, as if he were asking the owner of the house a question. The house is an old Victorian wooden building: under the cusp of the roof, there is a kind of rudder, which lacks rays. The covering of the house is made entirely of wood, and the man who lives there is dressed more classically, with a white shirt and suspenders, and is visibly happy for innovation.\n\nWith these details, Rockwell suggests the contrast between old and new. Observing the composition of the paintings, we can see how the TV antenna occupies the same position and has more or less the same form as the church steeples that are drawing in the landscape, on the right in the background. Rockwell is, ironically, and gently, saying that what we are witnessing is the beginning of a new religion, the transformation of time. From this moment, life will be 'before television' and 'after television'."

The image is thus at odds with the notions of 'high art', and approaches art making from the direction of artistic purity uninfluenced by cultural advancement. Going a step further, Dubuffet suggests how 'cultural' and the 'savage' approaches to art together work to reaffirm civilization as a whole. "

        "description": "Returning to Philadelphia from Europe in 1870, Eakins began a series of representations of the sport of sculling, a subject for which he is uniquely identified. [i]The Champion Single Sculls[/i] is the first significant work in that series of paintings and watercolors. It is believed to commemorate the victory of Max Schmitt, a friend of the artist and skilled amateur rower, in an important race on the Schuylkill River in October 1870. Also an avid rower, Eakins depicted himself pulling the oars of a scull in the middle distance.\n\nThe theme of rowing plays into Eakins\u2019 own love of sports and his tendency toward masculine themes, as well as the contemporary interest in the moral virtues and health benefits of outdoor recreational activities. In an era in which American printmakers were just beginning to take up the rowing craze and memorialize victorious single scullers as gentlemen and regional heroes, Eakins produced nineteen such rowing images.\n[i]The Champion Single Sculls[/i] debuted to mixed reviews, with one critic noting the \u201cscattered effect\u201d of \u201cdealing so boldly and broadly with the commonplace in nature.\u201d Nevertheless, it marked Eakins\u2019 first major success by demonstrating his remarkable technical skill. It also exhibits the artist\u2019s quirky sense of humor: instead of inscribing his signature in the painting\u2019s corner, Eakins subtly included his name and the date on the boat he is shown rowing in the distance. \n\n[i]The Champion Single Sculls[/i] is ultimately a snapshot of Eakins, his environment, and his times. Utilizing the Philadelphia-area Schuylkill River as his backdrop (a landmark he would indirectly visit again in his 1877 [url href=William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuykill River]portrait of William Rush[/url]), Eakins is domesticating an exotic genre, that of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/orientalism]Orientalist[/url] river scenes by artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-leon-gerome]Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me[/url] and Frederick Arthur Bridgman."

There it was Monet\u2019s convictions which especially affected him, and although he never became particularly interested in landscape as such, took to painting people out of doors.\r\n\r\nHere he has captured Monet and his wife Camille in the boat which the painter used as a floating studio, rowing it up and down the Seine and stopping whenever he spotted a promising subject. Monet was often desperately poor, but could always rely on a loan from Manet \u2013 who was equally unpopular but less dependent on art for his income.\r\n\r\nThanks to Monet\u2019s influence, Manet painted more often in the open air and lightened his palette. This picture receives a new freedom in treatment, Manet using smaller, more sketchy strokes and a brighter range of colors, and picking up in typical Impressionist fashion the light reflected from water and the almost abstract play of colors broken up by the ripples.\r\n\r\nMonet used the \u2018floating studio\u2019 to paint many scenes along the River Seine, capturing \u2018the effects of light from one twilight to the next\u2019. Manet was to describe Monet as \u201cthe Raphael of water\u201d."

As with most of his subjects taken from the Bible, Bruegel treats Saul's suicide as a contemporary event, showing the armies in 16th century armour.\n\nThe Suicide of Saul is an early attempt by Bruegel to reconcile landscape and figure painting. If it is compared with one of his latest works, The Magpie on the Gallows of 1568, its weaknesses are apparent: the foreground and background are not yet reconciled and the jutting outcrop of rock in the centresee 2nd detail is a mannerist device which one may see again in The Procession to Calvary. However, the distant landscape is seen through a shimmering haze, which seems to have the effect of emphasizing the foreground detail, and this does represent a new stage in the evolution of Bruegel's depiction of naturalistic landscape."

        "description": "This work is one of the mysteries of European painting: in spite of its undeniable quality and epochal importance, opinions are divergent concerning both its creator and its theme. It is the outstanding masterpiece of the Venetian Renaissance, the summit of Giorgione's creative career, so much so that according to some it may have been painted, or at least finished, by Titian rather than Giorgione.\r\n\r\nThe painting has been interpreted as an allegory of Nature, similar to Giorgione's Storm, which was undeniably painted by him; it was even viewed as the first example of the modern herdsman genre. Its message must be more complex than this. It is likely that the master consciously unified several themes in this painting, and the deciphering of symbols required a degree of erudition even at the time of its creation. During the eighteenth century the painting was known by the simple name of \"Pastorale\" and only subsequently was it given the title \"F\u00eate champ\u00eatre\" or \"Concert champ\u00eatre\", owing to its festive mood. Modern research has pointed out that the composition is in fact an allegory of poetry.\r\n\r\nThe female figures in the foreground are probably the Muses of poetry, their nakedness reveals their divine being. The standing figure pouring water from a glass jar represents the superior tragic poetry, while the seated one holding a flute is the Muse of the less prestigious comedy or pastoral poetry. The well-dressed youth who is playing a lute is the poet of exalted lyricism, while the bareheaded one is an ordinary lyricist. The painter based this differentiation on Aristotle's \"Poetica\".\r\n\r\nThe scenery is characterized by a duality. Between the elegant, slim trees on the left, we see a multi-levelled villa, while on the right, in a lush grove, we see a shepherd playing a bagpipe. Yet the effect is completely unified. The very presence of the beautiful, mature Muses provides inspiration; the harmony of scenery and figures, colours and forms proclaims the close interrelationship between man and nature, poetry and music."

        "description": "[b]Gongola Traditional Musician[/b]\nLutes are of two main types, those with trough-shaped resonators usually carved from a block of wood, and those with ovoid or circular resonators made from gourds. These are typically spike-lutes, in other words the neck is a stick that passes into the body of the resonator and the strings are looped over it once they pass the bridge, which is held to the skin soundboard by the pressure of the strings. More recently, small \ninstruments with resonators from sardine tins or even plastic bottles can be seen. The strings were typically gut or tendons, but are now usually made of nylon. Historically, these instruments seem to be associated with the northern regions and are typical of Hausa and Kanuri, but it seems they were long ago absorbed into the traditional music of many peoples of the Plateau.The musical bow is found west of the Plateau proper, in the region of Southern Zaria. Shaped like a hunting bow, the string is held between the open lips so that the mouth acts as a resonant cavity. The performer holds \na short stick in one hand and presses it against the string to divide it at intervals to produce different harmonic series. Another longer and thinner stick then strikes the string directly; by altering the shape of the mouth cavity, the different harmonic can be emphasized in the same manner as a Jews\u2019 harp. The musical bow is associated with the agricultural year and can be played together with a singer for songs of social \ncomment. \nThe earliest record of Nigerian music appears to be Day (1892) who analysed some musical instruments and transcriptions brought back by the Mockler-Ferryman \nexpedition up the Niger. Some of his material is clearly form the Igbo \nareas, but instruments such as the arched harp are typical of Central Nigeria, along with the cruciform whistle and the transverse horn. \n\nTraditional music in Nigeria is strongly associated with its oral culture and with the subsistence agriculture typical of village communities. In larger ethnic groups such as the Hausa and Yoruba, a thriving urban culture has allowed various musical genres to make the transition to cities and to be taken up by radio and television. However, for minority ethnic groups, this division does not exist; when households migrate to  towns they find it difficult to maintain their language and still more village music."

Always the [i]grand seigneur[/i], he claimed in a letter to his sister that Maximilian, King of Bavaria, with whom he is said to have been on friendly terms, invested him with the title of Count. Though research in the Commonwealth and Bavaria archives has not been able to confirm this, Demetrius used the title freely in official documents, styling himself as the \u2018Honourable Count Demetrius de Palatiano\u2019. In late 1825, on his way to Corfu from England, he passed through Paris, where he posed for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix]Delacroix[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/count-demetrius-de-palatiano-in-suliot-costume-1827][i]Count Demetrius de Palatiano in Suliot Costume[/i][/url] (c.1825-1827). \n\nIn the winter of 1825-1816, Bonington worked in Delacroix\u2019s studio, and, influenced by him,  turned to the genre and history painting. Artists worked closely together, manifesting a strong coloristic emphasis, sharing models and compositions. The most complete evidence of common subject matter and a very similar approach is to be found in the sketches that Delacroix and Bonington made for their portraits of Count Demetrius Palatiano in the costume of a Palikar.\n\nDemetius is portrayed wearing the uniform of a Suliot, consisting of a long, white skirt, or [i]foustanella,[/i] gold-worked cloak, crimson velvet gold-laced jacket, and a waist-coat, silver-mounted pistols and daggers. The Suliots were Greek/Albanian Christians who had fled from the repression of Ali Pasha when he became governor of Jannina in 1822, and who later fought courageously during the Greek War of Independence. This war was a source of great interest for the rest of Europe and the exotic costumes of Greek soldiers, also known as Suliots or Palikari, became a popular subject matter amongst artists. If from a pictorial point of view, it may have been the costume that most attracted Delacroix and Bonington to Count de Palatiano, his colorful and extravagant personality must have also had a strong appeal at a period when the memory of Byron deeply influenced French [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism]Romantic Art[/url]. Byron posed in the habit of a Palikar for his famous portrait by Thomas Philips and recruited a number of them to form his private guard prior to his arrival in Missolonghi in 1824. Portrayed as fearsome and independent in [i]Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage[/i], Suliots were seen by Romantic artists as modern primitives, embodiments of natural purity unspoiled by civilization. In the present work, Palatiano stands with his back to the viewer. The bright golden hues of his dress, painted with spontaneous loose brushstrokes, stand in strong contrast against the muted background, accentuating the Count\u2019s flamboyant and distinctly Byronic cast."

Even the background, in an articulated spatial structure marked by tree trunks, and the closure of the field with a high wall on the right side lead back to the many real-life sketches made around the Pellizza house during 1890-91. The background is occupied by episodes of rural work; in the foreground dominates the scene, certainly of the genre but immune to any sketches, of the girls who act as mothers to their siblings, arranged according to a pyramidal composition. The apparent simplicity of the theme gives way to a skilful construction of the image, so much so as to earn the painter his first important awards: the gold medal and critical acclaim at the Italian-American exhibition in Genoa in 1892.

The painting portrays a nude woman gracefully dancing on the surface of a pond, holding a lily in her arm as she reaches to smell it. Bouguereau's skillful depiction of the dancer's pose, with her balancing on the water's skin, and the soft cool tones of her skin reflect the tranquil atmosphere of early morning. The diaphanous drapery swirling around her, combined with her suspended pose and mirrored reflection, create an otherworldly effect.\n\nThroughout his career, Bouguereau repeatedly employed the motif of the female nude, arranging the body in various suggestive poses while often referencing myths or literature. His focus on the single figure in works such as Dawn allowed him to showcase his mastery of line and handling of subtle color contrasts, resulting in a sinuous and atmospheric depiction of early morning. The model's fingers and toes tinged with pink reflect Homer's description of daybreak as \"rosy-fingered dawn, the child of morning.\" Despite the lack of a specific mythological or literary reference, Bouguereau always imbued his female nudes with a sense of classicism and poetry.\n\nAdolphe Goupil, Bouguereau's regular dealer, acquired the 'times-of-day' series, which he then sold to various American collectors. The sale of the series is a testament to Bouguereau's unparalleled critical and commercial success in both European and American art markets during his lifetime."

But, rather than the early picture, which contained many different paintbrushes and an example of her work in the frame, in this picture she is counterpoised against a blank, dark background, looking at the viewer at an almost downward angle. Though she still holds a palette in her hand, there only appears to be one color on there, and her easel is not visible. The focus is on the artist and not on the process of art-making itself.\n\nRather than the light color palette of the other self-portrait, and in contrast to her other work in general, Leyster here chooses a striking selection of blacks, whites and browns. The muted colors in this image along with the stern look upon Leyster's face seems to suggest that this is a woman who wants to communicate her seriousness to the viewer. Moreover, her upright position suggests the gravity of her craft: this is a painting that speaks of deep experience, a life lived in painting. Her dress, while similarly somber, still attests to her financial success and technical mastery of her craft with its delicate lace details."

For 'Spellbound' she contributed pictures inspired by three of her favourite Disney films - Snow White, Pinocchio and Fantasia. It was Fantasia she concentrated on, the most abstract of Disney's films, his inspiration of famous pieces of classical music through animation.\r\n\r\nRego purposely did not look at the film but relied on her memory and an occasional glance at John Cluhane's illustrated history of Fantasia. In the film the ostriches perform the waking or 'Morning' sequence from Dance of the Hours, a ballet in the opera La Gioconda (The Smiling One) by Amilcare Ponchielli, first performed in 1876. Cluhane writes that in the first stages the animators made sketches of ballet dancers who were brought to the studio to perform positions and movements, \"the equivalent of a model's holding poses for an artist who draws still pictures\". The models were turned into birds, sometimes quite literally. As those present recalled there was \"a very tall, very ostrichlike girl, and she loved doing the burlesque of the ostrich for us.We put a few feathers on her costume where ostrich feathers should appear, and a bow on her head, and she performed the routine to perfection.\" Rego reserves this process, turning the birds back into people."

The inscription on the parapet does not help. These letters, VVO, have been interpreted as a form of the Latin vivo (in life). This would suggest that the portrait was painted from life and that it confers on both subject and painter a measure of immortality. It may more likely, however, be an abbreviation of a humanist motto, perhaps virtus vincit omnia (virtue conquers all).\r\n\r\nLike other paintings associated with Giorgione, this one presents difficulties of attribution. Both Titian and Sebastiano are know to have completed works that remained unfinished when Giorgione died prematurely in his early thirties. (It was said that Giorgione contracted the plague from his mistress.) A second hand seems to be at work in this painting. The portrait's format, with subject glancing sidelong at the viewer from behind a parapet, was developed by Giorgione, and the soft, shadowy gradations of tone also recall his style. However, its aggressive mood points to a painter with a bolder brush and more active, worldly outlook, like Titian."

The background, loosely defined floral patterns, and the trimmings on the woman's dress contribute to the highly dynamic feel of the painting. According to Peter J. G\u00e4rtner, the dense vegetation serves as a protective shield, shutting out the external world and safeguarding the young woman's innocence and beauty. This intimate connection between the viewer and the sitter is further enhanced by the enclosed background and tight angle.\n\nThe painting's lengthy, unkempt brushwork is a characteristic feature of Morisot's late 1870s work, which creates a \"vibration of color and light\" that was previously unseen in her paintings, as noted by Nathalia Brodskaia. The painting invites comparison to Mary Cassatt's Woman with a Pearl Necklace in a Loge, painted in the same year, which features a similarly attired woman seated in an upper-level box at the Paris Opera. Cassatt's painting explores the intersection of public and private spaces and the power of 19th-century women to command a public persona. In contrast, Morisot's subject appears apprehensive and distracted, as if she is waiting for someone before leaving the unknown event. The dynamic brushwork underscores the uncertain nature of both the woman's thoughts and the overall scene."

It was commissioned by Edward H. Coates, a Philadelphia businessman who was then Chairman of the Committee on Instruction at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where Eakins taught for a decade. The painting was shown in the Academy's 1885 annual exhibition but was soon returned to the artist by the patron, who exchanged it for a less controversial genre scene, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-eakins/the-pathetic][i]The Pathetic Song[/i][/url] (1881).\n\nWithin months, in 1886, Eakins was dismissed from the Academy, where his demands for the study of the nude offended Victorian propriety. [i]The Swimming Hole[/i], by its subject and provenance closely associated with this painful moment in Eakins' career, was exhibited only once more during his lifetime, in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1886. It remained in the painter's possession until his death thirty years later.\n\nThe painting's well-known title, The Swimming Hole, was first used in 1917, probably at Mrs. Eakins' suggestion. The artist called it [i]Swimming[/i] and [i]The Swimmers [/i], emphasizing not the place, but the action and the figures. Eakins took numerous photographs of these young men swimming, and he presents them on the canvas as they appeared in real life without any romanticizing effects. The unsentimental and frank depiction of the male nude in various poses has sparked much debate. The voyeuristic element of the paintings compounded when one learns that Eakins painted himself into the scene as the figure swimming toward the rock. Whether an innocent depiction of male camaraderie and frivolity, an acknowledgment of latent gay desire, a celebration of the nude form focusing on muscle, bone, and anatomy, or a deliberate attempt to court controversy and propel one's reputation, the painting is still a subject of debate more than a century after the artist's death."

The painting is the plastic equivalent of Verlaine's poetic style which the painter appreciated for its simplicity, naivety and the \"mysterious relationships between things and people\". The composition is carried by a rising diagonal formed by the group of women and the upright of the Cross. The women have lost all individuality and melt into an extremely simplified black mass, counterbalanced by the other dark mass of Roman soldiers in the background. Even Christ, brought to his knees by the weight of the Cross and embraced by a Holy Woman, is painted as a silhouette, in flat colour with a dark outline. Denis has given the scene great decorative unity and, as in Verlaine's poem, it becomes the expression of universal grief and compassion."

Only four years later, on 14th May 1970 Meinhof took part in the forcible rescue of Andreas Baader from prison \u2013 commonly seen as the beginning of the RAF.\n\n In adapting the photograph, the artist has made some changes: Ulrike Meinhof seems to be much younger, her gaze seems decidedly less determined and her mouth is set less vigorously then on the source image. By blurring the still wet paint Richter heightens the youthful and delicate appearance of the portrait. Meinhof\u2019s gaze emits an almost melancholic reflectiveness (Richter himself called the painting \u201csentimental in a bourgeois way\u201c) and the painting\u2019s title underlines Richter\u2019s intention of showing Meinhof as a young woman that seems to be inexperienced, unsuspecting and almost childlike. The composition and the arrangement of the portrait in front of a dark background are remindful of portraits of actors or paintings in the way of old masters and focus the attention on Meinhof herself.\n\n[i]Youth Portrait[/i] contrasts strongly with the rest of the cycle that broaches the issue of the death of the RAF leaders. It is a comparatively small painting that by way of Meinhof\u2019s direct gaze evokes an almost intimate relationship with the viewer, intensified by the fact that many people might own a similar portrait of themselves. The image of one of the leader of the terrorists, effectively created and influenced by the media, is thus put into perspective and contradicted by the apparent harmlessness of the portrait. Richter\u2019s [i]Youth Portrait[/i] also evokes thoughts about the time that has passed between the shot of the photograph and the paintings that show Ulrike Meinhof after her suicide as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/dead-1988][i]Dead[/i][/url] (1988) and contrasts them with a \u201cpure\u201d vision of the past.\n\nUlrike Meinhof thus appears as a person and not as a character contorted by the media that is alternatively demonized or mystified but always dehumanised. Her portrait invites the viewer to identify with her on a personal level and hints that every person is capable of possibly committing similar crimes.\n\nFrom [url href=https://www.gerhard-richter.com/en/art/paintings/photo-paintings/baader-meinhof-56/youth-portrait-7697/?p=1&sp=32]www.gerhard-richter.com[/url]"

Freud's friends introduced them, hoping that Bowery's flamboyant style, which included bright colors and sequins, would inspire Freud to abandon his usual drab palette. Being obstinate, Freud asked Bowery to shave his whole body. Freud saw Bowery's muscular legs as his best feature, and often showcases them in a series of unusually unselfconscious and passive poses that thwart the conventions of male portraiture.\n\nIn Man with Leg Up, Bowery lies on the floor with his legs splayed. One leg rests on the bed while the other bends underneath him, as if keeping him from sliding down the floor, which tilts toward us. Nearly all elements in this scene, from the supine pose to the splayed legs indicates vulnerability. Exaggerated foreshortening makes Bowery's top half appear further away, highlighting the exposure of his hairless groin, which occupies the very center of the picture. Bowery seems at ease with this. His facial features are relaxed. His left arm cradles his head while his right is draped across his chest, regarding us as if to say, \"so what\"?\n\nThe two men developed a friendship, and Freud continued to paint Bowery over the course of four years, until his death from AIDS in 1994."

The artist portrays herself in a garlanded and feathered straw hat, adorned with lush fabrics of white, pink, and black, reminiscent of Rubens' earlier portrait of Susanna Lunden, known as The Straw Hat (1622-1625). In contrast to the coy sensuality of Rubens' painting, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun depicts herself as a self-assured artist, holding her palette and brushes in one hand and gesturing with the other in a friendly manner. Her mouth is upturned, and her gaze meets the viewer's, indicating her amusement or readiness to speak. The background features a clouded sky, creating a contrast with the vibrancy of the subject.\n\nVig\u00e9e Le Brun's popularity was fueled by her self-image, which she masterfully presents in this painting. Her youthful blush, almond eyes, and partially exposed white breast accentuate her beauty, emphasizing her selling power. The sumptuous clothing not only suggests wealth and luxury but also the artist's skill in painting textures and details, which is evident in the shine of the colors on her palette. The painting projects the idea that a portrait by Vig\u00e9e Le Brun will be a flattering, meticulous, and pleasant experience, blurring the line between fine art and advertising. The acknowledgment of Rubens' influence in the painting also establishes Vig\u00e9e Le Brun as a painter aware of the tradition of the Old Masters and worthy of their legacy."

        "description": "[i]Totes Meer (Dead Sea)[/i] was painted during the Second World War. Nash wanted to title the work using the original German as he intended the picture to be seen by the German people and to reveal the fall and failure of their military attempts to dominate Europe. As such, the work can in a way be viewed as a subtle, patriotic statement in support of the British war effort. It was submitted to the War Artists' Advisory Committee in 1941 - for whom Nash worked intermittently throughout WWII - and shows a \"dead sea\" of destroyed German planes.\n\nNash based this painting on sketches and photographs that he had made and taken at the Metal and Produce Recovery Unit near his Oxford home. He then collaged his collection of images together to create a fragmented sea of battered remnants. He particularly wanted to represent German planes (as opposed to the British ones occupying most of the recovery unit) so as to illustrate the fate of the \"hundreds and hundreds of flying creatures which invaded these shores\". His unrealized vision was to distribute a postcard of this image throughout Germany as propaganda. Somewhat grimly, he even created a version of the painting with Hitler's head collaged on to the damaged aircraft, for this purpose. A year later, he extended this interest and made the work [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-nash/follow-the-fuhrer-above-the-clouds-1942][i]Follow the Fuhrer Above the Clouds[/i][/url] (1942), whereby a squadron of German aircraft fly through the sky accompanied by a huge flying shark. Here Nash successfully uses techniques of Surrealist collage to convey the colossal and brutalising force of Adolf Hitler.\n\nParadoxically, the inclusion of the moon in the background of [i]Totes Meer[/i] adds \"incongruous beauty\" to the painting and in typical Nash style, suggests the unwavering power of nature, in spite of man's atrocities. The landscape beyond the broken sea of planes suggests that salvation remains a possibility and that the destruction, though horrific, is not total. Kenneth Clark called [i]Totes Meer[/i] \"the best war picture so far\", and this is an opinion still held by many. Of this painting and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-nash/battle-of-britain-1941][i]The Battle of Britain[/i][/url] (1944), Clark further commented on Nash, \"you have discovered a new form of allegorical painting. It is impossible to paint great events without allegory ... and you have discovered a way of making the symbols out of the events themselves\".\n\n[url href=https://www.theartstory.org/artist/nash-paul/artworks/][b]by TheArtStory[/b][/url]"

He used a landscape he had painted in Collioure to provide the setting for the idyll, but it is also influenced by ideas drawn from Watteau, Poussin, Japanese woodcuts, Persian miniatures, and 19th century Orientalist images of harems. The scene is made up of independent motifs arranged to form a complete composition. The massive painting and its shocking colors received mixed reviews at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants.

The presentation of the subject was unusual for its time: previous Papal portraits showed them frontally or kneeling in profile. It was also exceptional at this period to show the sitter so evidently in a particular mood. In fact, Julius was depressed because the city of Bologna had seceded from the papal states. He expressed his grief at this political disaster by growing a beard, imitating what Renaissance humanists had discovered was an ancient form of mourning. It is the beard that enables this portrait to be dated 1511-12.

Throughout his life, Frans Hals executed several military group portraits, one of the most famous being [i]The company of Captain Reinier Reael and Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz Blaeuw[/i] (1633-1637). The painting is also known as [i]The Meagre Company[/i], because of the slim figures of the officers. In 1633, Hals received a commission from the St. George Civic Guard of Amsterdam under Captain Reael and Lieutenant Blaeuw to paint a military group portrait. However, due to a dispute between Hals and the officers, the painting was completed by Amsterdam painter, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-codde]Pieter Codde[/url] in 1637. The disagreement, documented in a series of letters, sheds light on Hals\u2019s process of painting. After creating the composition, Hals began to work from left to right. As the letters reveal, Hals made several trips to Amsterdam. Still, he had difficulty gathering all the officers for a sitting, which impaired his ability to finish the painting in time. Eventually, Hals suggested that all the officers come to Haarlem for a sitting; Reael and Blaeuw refused, and in turn, demanded that Hals immediately travel to Amsterdam to complete the work. For this reason, the sides ultimately parted ways, but from the exchange, it is clear that Hals needed the sitters\u2019 presence at multiple stages of the work process. At first, Hals required the assembling of the entire group to conceive the composition, and later, he needed time with each sitter to create the individual portraits.\n\nHals created a complex composition, in which he arranged the sixteen figures in three planes. The standing men formed a strong vertical balance, which was offset by the slanted position of the weaponry. The composition of the grouping on the left side closely resembles another military group portrait by Hals, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals/the-officers-of-the-st-adrian-militia-company-1633][i]The Officers of St Adrian Militia Company[/i][/url] (1633). Through a variety of poses, Hals\u2019s composition generated a sense of drama and dynamics. The artist demonstrated his virtuosity through his ability to create textures and materials: silk sashes, intricate lace collars, chamois boots, and metal armors. He used the same approach for mustaches and hair; each strand is separated and carefully styled. The diversification of the hairstyles and facial hair adds to the individuality of each figure and gives an overall sense of vigor to the painting.\n\nMore than 200 years later, Hals\u2019s mastery was observed by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent van Gogh[/url] during his visit to Amsterdam in 1885. He was particularly impressed by Hal\u2019s understanding of color; in a letter to his brother Theo, Van Gogh wrote that Hals had twenty-seven shades of black. In [i]The Meagre Company[/i], Van Gogh was especially taken by the flag bearer farthest on the left, and Hals\u2019s ability to create a variety of materials using the same pearl-grey color. This ability also relates to the bright silvery daylight filling the space of the painting. The light displays the sharp facial features and reflects in the glasses, brocades, silks, metal armors, and weapons. The silver tonality in Hal\u2019s painting was possibly inspired by the artwork of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/utrecht-school]Utrecht Caravaggisti[/url] painter, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hendrick-terbrugghen]Hendrick Terbrugghen[/url]."

Paul, born in 1842, was the son of Eduard Meyerheim, the respected Berlin genre painter, with whom Menzel had been friends since 1834 and had an artistic exchange. Meyerheim painted Menzel's portrait around 1840, who in turn portrayed Meyerheim's wife Karoline in 1847, the sister of the sculptor Friedrich Drake, who was friends with Menzel. Over the years, a multiple exchange developed with Paul, both artistically and privately. Both were united by their interest in animal and zoo motifs, and when Menzel's famous iron rolling mill was built in the early 1870s, Meyerheim was working on a cycle on the \u201cHistory of a Locomotive\u201d for the Borsig industrial family. Paul reports in great detail about Menzel's visit to the world exhibition in Paris in 1867, where Meyerheim was already staying and had prepared Menzel's stay. They roamed the city \"to the extreme slack\" and what is known about Menzel's encounters with Meissonier and Courbet, we know from Meyerheim's little book. Our little portrait of our friend comes from the following year, in which Menzel visited Paris again, this time without Meyerheim. It shows Meyerheim thoughtfully turned to the right with a distinctive profile; the portrait inserted into the oval and kept in dark colors - \"the only concession to a color of its own is found in the ingenious treatment of the patterned tie\" (Claude Keisch). One thinks one can sense echoes of similar portraits of Courbet or French contemporaries from a distance. It is uncertain whether the painting was in the possession of the sitter. In 1905 it did not appear at the large commemorative exhibition for which Meyerheim was the lender, and it was not listed in Meyerheim's estate, which was auctioned off by Rudolph Lepke in Berlin in 1916 and 1919 - it did not appear in the Abraham Adelsberger collection until 1930 back on.

The subject of this landscape, London Bridge, was one of several bridges built across the River Thames as part of a larger movement at the turn of the 19th century to modernize the city center with grand new architectural projects and public works.

Nineteenth-century London saw a huge growth in population (from 1 million in 1800 to over 6 million a century later) as mechanical industry, especially the building of railways, took hold. Derain saw the changes and created a portrait of London that was radically different from anything done by previous painters of the city. The artist later recalled: \u201cFauvism was our ordeal by fire. . . It was the era of photography. This may have influenced us and played a part in our reaction against anything resembling a snapshot of life. No matter how far we moved away from things, it was never far enough.

        "description": "The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up is an oil painting executed in 1839 by the English artist J. M. W. Turner. It depicts one of the last second-rate ships of the line which played a distinguished role in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, the 98-gun ship HMS Temeraire, being towed by a paddle-wheel steam tug towards its final berth in Rotherhithe south east London in 1838 to be broken up for scrap. The painting hangs in the National Gallery, London, having been bequeathed to the nation by the artist in 1851. In 2005 it was voted the nation's favourite painting in a poll organized by BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Newbolt wrote a ballad titled The Fighting Temeraire, referencing the scenario depicted: \"And she's fading down the river, But in England's song for ever, She's the Fighting T\u00e9m\u00e9raire.\" Turner himself presented the painting for display in 1839 accompanied by an altered excerpt from Thomas Campbell's poem Ye Mariners of England, reading: \"The flag which braved the battle and the breeze,/No longer owns her.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Turner came to paint this picture in 1839 he was at the height of his career, having exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, for 40 years. He was renowned for his highly atmospheric paintings in which he explored the subjects of the weather, the sea and the effects of light. He spent much of his life near the River Thames estuary and did many paintings of ships and waterside scenes, both in watercolour and in oils. Turner frequently made small sketches and then worked them into finished paintings in the studio. He was present when this ship was towed and made some sketches of it. However, he appears to have used some license in the finished painting, which has taken on symbolic meaning. The painting is of a ship being towed away for scrap. It is highly metaphorical as the ship has performed great service for its country and is now being removed from society.\r\n\r\nThe composition of this painting is unusual in that the most significant object, the old warship, is positioned well to the left of the painting, where it rises in stately splendour and almost ghostlike colours against a triangle of blue sky and rising mist that throws it into relief. The beauty of the old ship is in stark contrast to the dirty blackened tugboat with its tall smokestack, which scurries across the still surface of the river \"like a water beetle\".\r\n\r\nTurner has used the triangle of blue to frame a second triangle of masted ships, which progressively decrease in size as they become more distant. Temeraire and tugboat have passed a small river craft with its gaff rigged sail barely catching a breeze. Beyond this a square-rigger drifts, with every bit of sail extended. Another small craft shows as a patch of white farther down the river. In the far distance, beyond the second tugboat which makes its way towards them, a three-masted ship rides at anchor. The becalmed sailing vessels show the obsolescence of sail. On the opposite side of the painting to Temeraire, and exactly the same distance from the frame as the ship's main mast, the sun sets above the estuary, its rays extending into the clouds above it, and across the surface of the water. The flaming red of the clouds is reflected in the river. It exactly repeats the colour of the smoke which pours from the funnel of the tugboat. The sun setting symbolises the end of an epoch in the history of the British Royal Navy. The demise of heroic strength is the subject of the painting, and it has been suggested that the ship stands for the artist himself, with an accomplished and glorious past but now contemplating his mortality. Turner called the work his \"darling\", which may have been due to its beauty, or his identification with the subject."

Poussin created two sets of seven sacraments, the first if which was commissioned by Cassiano del Pozzo, an Italian scholar and art collector, and the set was later sold to the Dukes of Rutland in the 18th century. All of the seven paintings remain except for \u201cPenance,\u201d which was destroyed in a fire at the Rutland Belvoir Castle in 1816. \u201cBaptism\u201d was sold to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC in 1939.

The panel was thus one of the works commissioned by the Medici to van der Weyden, including the Medici Madonna now at St\u00e4del of Frankfurt, which has been also assigned to the artist's trip to Italy in 1450. Another hypothesis is that the panel was part of a lost triptych painted for Lionello d'Este of Ferrara, and mentioned in 1449, or that it was the painting described by Giorgio Vasari as Hans Memling's.\r\n\r\nThe panel adopts the same scheme in Fra Angelico's Piet\u00e0 for the predella of the San Marco Altarpiece (1438\u20131443), now at the Alte Pinakothek of Munich, confirming that the Flemish artist visited Florence during his pilgrimage in Italy of 1449-1450, as confirmed by De viribus illustribus by Bartolomeo Facio (c. 1456). The work was later part of the collections of cardinal Carlo de' Medici, being moved to the Uffizi Gallery in 1666. Filippo Baldinucci described it as a work by Albrecht D\u00fcrer. In 1989 it was still assigned to Hans Memling by some scholars, but in 1992 a 1992 a reflex photography showed the underlying drawing, which was clearly executed by van der Weyden.\r\n\r\nThe painting has a rectangular shape, and shows Christ being buried with the weeping Mary and John the Evangelist holding his hands. The corpse is supported by a richly dressed Joseph of Arimathea (identified by some as a portrait of Cosimo de' Medici) and by Nicodemus, perhaps a self-portrait of the artist. A kneeling Mary Magdalene is depicted in the low foreground.\r\n\r\nThe composition is similar to Angelico's Piet\u00e0, but the scene here is more complex and crowded, with less geometrically ordered lines and more anguished faces. The use of oil paint also allowed van der Weyden to obtain deeper colors and a more brilliant light. The attention to details is also typical of the early Netherlandish painting school."

        "description": "In late 1905, Cosmopolitan magazine began publishing serial installments of one of Remington\u2019s most successful novels, The Way of an Indian. The novel chronicles the life story of a Cheyenne man as emblematic of the life and death of his people. Born on the open plains, the man develops into Fire Eater, a fearsome warrior and chief. However, despite his bravery and skill, he becomes increasingly powerless as his tribe falls before the steady encroachments of the white man. By the time Fire Eater has reached old age, he and his tribe are decisively defeated in a final battle with the U.S. Cavalry. Although Fire Eater manages to escape with a few survivors into the mountains, he leaves the body of his son and the defiant spirit of his people behind. The novel ends with the despairing old chief calling to the spirits to take him away, so he can enter the shadow-land and return to the glory days of his youth. The themes in Remington\u2019s novel have their visual counterpart in Ridden Down, completed the same year as the novel. Here a lone warrior, stripped for battle and covered with green \u201cmedicine\u201d paint for protection, stands on the edge of a bluff next to his gasping, sweat-lathered horse, which has been ridden to exhaustion. A badlands landscape stretches all around them like an ocean of shimmering yellows, as a band of Indians gallops toward them from the desert flats far below. Like Fire Eater in Remington\u2019s novel, this warrior stoically calls to the spirits while awaiting his inevitable fate. The story told by this painting is simple, yet very powerful. \u201cBig art is the process of elimination,\u201d Remington was quoted as saying a few years earlier. \u201cCut down and out\u2014do your hardest work outside the picture, and let your audience take away something to think about\u2014to imagine.\u201d"

A certain type of woman is characteristic of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries - she has long, loose hair, half-closed eyes and sensual lips, such a woman can be treated both as a being stuck in melancholic contemplation and as a demonic creature.\n\nActress Maria Leiko is considered to be the possible prototype, but it is more likely that she was a lady seen at the carnival - German-Baltic gymnast Goto Betge, someone else mentions Finnish dancer Maggie Gripenberg. In a broader sense, the depicted image of a woman fits into the broader context of European art of the beginning of the 20th century. However, there is no doubt about the identity of the monkey. Rosenthal's son Mi\u0137elis remembered: \"Every morning a gypsy came to Albert Street 12 with a monkey. The father used the monkey as a model, and the gypsy received 1 ruble for each day.'' \n\nP\u0101vilas Gruzna, on the other hand, thought that the painting indirectly depicted the artist as a servant and plaything for fine art, which is a more common opinion, because at the turn of the 20th century the princess was a symbol of beauty, A. Brigadere and Aspazija also used it. However, the possibility that the message of the painting expresses the artist's inner experience cannot be ruled out. \"The Princess and the Monkey\" is painted on an ornamental background, the format of the painting is vertical, its formal solution shows the artist's passion for Japanese engraving. There are several versions of the painting (the artist varied with the details and format size). The first draft is in the charcoal and pencil technique, in the next stage it is drawn on paper and duplicated on cardboard.\n\n[url href=https://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princese_ar_p%C4%93rti%C4%B7i][source][/url]"

It is the time when the light is low, just before the sun sinks to its rest. The whole landscape is suffused with a glow from the setting luminary striking athwart the valley, lighting up the middle distance, which is very well rendered, and shimmering over the surface of the shallow water, above which some swallows are winging their arrowy flight. Gum trees line the sloping sides of the stream, the foreground being broken up with large boulders and reeds, the near foreground falling into shadow, which, like the crest of the ploughed field in the distance, is growing grey as sober evening with dewy fingers draws 'The gradual dusky veil'. The tone and colour of the landscape is very agreeable, the water admirable, and the whole work is in good keeping\".\r\n'The Australasian sketcher with pen and pencil', Melbourne, 11 November 1882\r\n\r\nThe Merri Creek runs for approximately 70 kms, beginning near Wallan, a town on Melbourne's northern outskirts, and joining the Yarra River at Dight's fall, Collingwood."

The painting also speaks not to sexual fulfillment, but the excitement of the game of courtship, just for the sheer satisfaction of playing the game.

This vessel is a pleyt \u2013 a single-mast, sprit-rigged, shallow draught, broad-hulled tub, very similar to a smalschip \u2013 adapted to carry large numbers of passengers slowly in calm inland waters. The two pleyten here are made to look as if successive views of the same vessel and show how the sail is lowered as the boat drifts towards the jetty. A drummer announces the arrival of the service and a man fends off with a bargepole. This is a remarkably large scale image of a boat, but there is nothing remarkable about the boat itself or the function it is performing. There are some burghers aboard the pleyt and the rowing-boat but no obvious dignitary; there are many ships in the background but nothing to suggest that this is a review of the Dutch fleet. What we see here is literally a daily occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe drama of presentation here does not just depend upon the isolation of the ferry and its scale. The water-skimming viewpoint means that the hull stands out against the horizon, which glows like a halo as the setting sun catches the mist coming off the sea; it also pushes the mast up into the clouds. These clouds are shaped rather like those in Rembrandt\u2019s Three Trees (British Museum) to suggest the forms of angels or zephyrs surrounding the light of the sky. Hoogstraten later advises artists to \u2018Observe the lovely gliding of the clouds, and how their drift and shapes are related to one another, because the eye of the artist must always recognise things by their essence while the common folk see only weird shapes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Peopled clouds\u2019 were familiar from allegorical prints, like that depicting the Dutch \u2018ship of state\u2019, produced in 1620 to celebrate the Synod of Dordrecht (1618-9) and showing the Stadholder, Prince Maurice of Orange, at the tiller, surrounded by the Seven Provinces, lit from the sky by a figure of Truth holding the States Bible, while the Pope drowns. This Passage Boat appears too ordinary to be a \u2018ship of state\u2019, yet the image carries the same visionary enthusiasm. This is probably intended to be a more private allegory of salvation of the type which a spiritual person reads in the ordinary fabric of the world. It would certainly be unlikely for a contemporary viewer to look at this boat without noticing that the mast and sprit-pole make a cross.\r\n\r\nSigned on the rudder A. c\u00fcyp\r\n(Text adapted from Dutch Landscapes, London, 2010)"

These pendant portraits represent Kane\u2019s initial plan for earning his living as an artist. They date from his two-year period in Cobourg, Ontario, when he took advantage of social connections to develop his skills in portraiture. He would have known the Clenches either through working for the Clench furniture business or through his contact with Wilson S. Conger, Kane\u2019s former employer in Toronto who moved to Cobourg in 1829 and became a prominent citizen through his positions in municipal office.1 \r\n          The paintings portray the Clenches as fashionably dressed, and Eliza\u2019s gold locket and earrings are especially indicative of the family\u2019s status. Kane\u2019s society portraits from this period reflect a professional competence within a naive, linear style. While some sense of the individual sitters is discernible, the elongated necks, enhanced by the fashion of the period, and the patterning of hair and costume mimic a stylization typical of portraiture at the time. The plain background with a broad halo effect behind the head is a focusing device Kane would continue to use throughout his career.\r\n          Although neither Clench portrait is signed (typical of Kane), they have been attributed to Kane based on the comparison of the pigments with the contents of his studio paint box,2  as well as on his close relationship with the Clench family. Both portraits were handed down through the family until their acquisition by the National Gallery of Canada in 1990."

The artist\u2019s portraits are marked by a sense of apparent directness and intimacy \u2013 as if we meet the sitters as equals, sharing a bond of mutual understanding. The Countess, casually posed, is at one with her wild surroundings; setting aside convention, she wears an unusually simple dress, inspired by Greek and Roman examples. The portrait holds out the promise of a life freed from society\u2019s constrictions and more in sympathy with nature \u2013 a vital element of Enlightenment thought."

        "description": "Born in rural Suffolk, the largely self-taught Gainsborough established his reputation as a society portraitist at Bath, a popular resort, before moving to London in 1774. Despite his urban success, he never lost his love of the countryside and coastline, lamenting, \"I'm sick of portraits and wish very much to ... walk off to some sweet village, where I can paint Landskips.\"\r\n\r\nGainsborough's landscapes, however, are seldom if ever of actual scenery. In accordance with much eighteenth-century art theory, he believed that nature itself was an unsuitable subject. Only after an artist had refined a scene through his sensibilities could he begin to paint it.\r\n\r\nIn the 1780s, Gainsborough experimented with a \"peep-show box.\" Using translucent paints, he created landscapes on sheets of glass that were then inserted into a shadow box. Backlit with candles, the miniature theatre permitted endless lighting schemes by means of changeable screens of colored silk. Depicting an imaginary seacoast, this canvas reveals the influence of Gainsborough's viewing box. Framed by the dark beach and pale cliff, the sky and surf seem phosphorescent.\r\n\r\nAs usual, Gainsborough improvised as he worked. The boulder in the lower-right corner conceals two fishermen and an anchor that he later painted out."

This painting marks the exact time when the orthodox Mannerism gave way to Baroque emotionality, and immediately catapulted Caravaggio into stardom. The scene was specifically requested by Cardinal Contarelli before his death, and that the painting should require three things: the saint being murdered by a soldier, onlookers showing emotions of shock and disgust, and architecture as the background element. The painting, upon being x-rayed, shows evidence that Caravaggio attempted two different compositions before completing the one we see today, eventually eliminating the architectural element entirely.

But instead of choosing a traditional view of a sitting room, bedroom or dining room, Caulfield has focussed on a confined area that is the junction between a landing and two corridors.\r\n\r\nAll the elements are perspectivally correct, but greatly simplified. The effect is to make the space seem simultaneously real and cartoon-like. Although the distance between the viewer and the furthest point in the scene is perhaps no more than twelve feet, there is nevertheless a strong sense of depth within the picture. This is because the foreground, middle ground and background are strongly delineated by the architecture and divide the canvas into thirds.\r\n\r\nCaulfield's domestic interiors are often lifted directly from 1950s interior decorating magazines and they retain their original aspirational mood. Devoid of narrative, Caulfield nevertheless imbues each canvas with a powerful emotional register by suffusing them with a dominant saturated colour. Frequently melancholic, these interiors are always totally still and without a human presence except maybe for a light left on.\r\n\r\nMany of his interior scenes also play with methods of portraying different forms, combinations and sources of light. He also incorporates trompe d'oeil and photorealistic elements in order to playfully explore the relationship between notions of reality, artifice and illusion. Caulfield was interested in showing how no one method of representation within an artwork can claim to be more or less 'real' than another. "

        "description": "From 1942 onwards, Nash had been visiting his friend and fellow artist Hilda Harrison's house in Oxfordshire, nearby his childhood home. Here he observed sunflowers obscuring his view of the Wittenham Clumps during summer. A curator at the Tate Gallery refers to his interest in the \"rhyming shapes\" of the rounded sunflower heads, hills, moon, and sun - a fascination that is reflected also by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-nash/we-are-making-a-new-world-1918][i]We Are Making a New World[/i][/url] (1918) with its shafts of sunlight, and the steady moon in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-nash/totes-meer-1941][i]Totes Meer[/i][/url] (1941). [i]Eclipse of the Sunflower[/i] is one in an intended series of four paintings in which Nash wanted to use the life cycle of the sunflower to represent the sun in the sky - referring to his ambition as \"exalt[ing]\" the image of the sunflower. Before his death in 1946, the artist completed both this work and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-nash/solstice-of-the-sunflower-1945][i]Solstice of the Sunflower[/i][/url] (1945) but did not manage to paint [i]The Sunflower Rises[/i] and [i]The Sunflower Sets[/i].\n\nThere are two sunflowers in [i]Eclipse of the Sunflower[/i], one in the bottom left, lying dead and withered, and one floating high in the position of the sun. This sunflower in the sky is healthy but is perhaps about to be eclipsed. The head of the dying sunflower has just become detached from its stem and thus some critics suggest that the picture represents looming death and the moment that the soul leaves the body. The inky background may have been inspired by the illustrations of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-blake]William Blake[/url], with details that are reminiscent of earlier landscape paintings, for example, the painterly cloud formations and waves in the bottom right corner. There is also a strong sense that the life cycle of the sunflower mirrors the waning and waxing of the moon, and thus the painting illustrates one of Nash's primary interests, that of death and rebirth and the ongoing continuum of natural forces.\n\n[i]Eclipse of the Sunflower[/i] is ever the more poignant image given Nash's first-hand experience of death during the war and now, that it is made shortly before his own life came to an end. Although he was only 57, the artist had been diagnosed with bronchial asthma and would die of pneumonia shortly after making this work. The artist's interest in the idea of renewal through death (inspired by poetry and religious myth) was influenced particularly by James Frazer's painting [i]The Golden Bough[/i] (1926), which describes a Midsummer ritual of rolling burning \"fire wheels\" down a hill to imitate the movement of the sun, and William Blake's beautiful poem [i]\"Ah! Sunflower\"[/i] (1794). With the life cycles of nature on his mind, Nash wrote in his essay [i]Aerial Flowers[/i] (published posthumously in 1947): \"Personally, I feel that if death can give us [a solution], death will be good.\"\n\n[url href=https://www.theartstory.org/artist/nash-paul/artworks/][b]by TheArtStory[/b][/url]"

        "description": "In 1929, Lempicka's most avid collectors (besides her future husband Baron Raoul Kuffner) Dr. Pierre Boucard commissioned a portrait of himself; the artist also painted several portraits of Boucard's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tamara-de-lempicka/portrait-of-mrs-boucard-1931]wife[/url] and his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tamara-de-lempicka/potrait-of-arlette-boucard-1928]daughter[/url]. A distinguished-looking, middle-aged man, the confident Boucard is framed by a background of white geometric shapes comprised of sharp angles. The darkness behind them creates a kind of mysterious contrast. In comparison to the somewhat flattened forms that make up the figure and the background, the microscope is fully realized formally. It anchors Boucard to the background; it is as though he holds onto it for balance.\n\nIn the picture, Boucard wears a smartly tailored white coat - a lab coat transformed into a chic outer garment that doesn't even hint at his vocation as a physician and researcher. Rather, he could be a military officer or, more intriguing still, a spy. Indeed, he stands in the shadows with his face turned toward the light. The pose seems to be defensive or protective of the objects he possesses: a test tube half-filled with fluid. Indeed, although Dr. Boucard was tangentially involved in cloak-and-dagger activities during the Second World War - his racing yacht was used by the French Resistance to transport munitions and was found by the Nazis and scuttled (then later purchased by Greek tycoon, Aristotle Onassis), Boucard's claim to fame as a famous French bacteriologist - hence the test tube and the microscope - was his 1907 isolation of [i]Lactobacillus acidophilus[/i], which he developed into an antidiarrheal drug called Lacetol. The discovery and subsequent development of the drug made Bourcard quite wealthy; thus, he had the finances to commission multiple portraits from Lempicka. The portrait is an idealized image of the doctor, whose work was far from glamorous."

In the picture, four contorted, nude women recline in a complex tangle of rounded, heavily modeled, and sharply outlined body parts. The robust, sensual figures with their sultry expressions are reminiscent of the nude bathers of Lempicka's artistic predecessors - from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres]Ingres[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix]Delacroix[/url] to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse]Matisse[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Picasso[/url].\n\nLempicka's figures have been likened to Ingres's fleshy and distorted but elegant bathers, such as those pictured in the work, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres/the-turkish-bath-1863][i]Turkish Baths[/i][/url] (1862). However, the piece must also be analyzed in comparison to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cubism]Cubist[/url] works, including but not exclusively, nudes by Picasso such as [[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/nudes-interlaces-1905]i]Two Nudes[/i][/url] (1905) or for that matter, the groundbreaking [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/the-girls-of-avignon-1907][i]Les demoiselles d'Avignon[/i][/url] (1907). Lempicka absorbed tradition but was also deeply influenced by Cubism.\n\nThe shallow background of the picture, which is typical of post-Cubist compositions, has the effect of making the women feel even more compressed within the space, thereby also heightening the eroticism. Art historian Joan Cox argues that \"[Lempicka] has chosen to crop her view of the female bathers tightly and give the viewer - a presumably female viewer - the experience of joining in the frolicking. She invites the female viewer in as a lover rather than creating an experience for a male viewer as a distant voyeur into this all-female public space.\" Indeed, works like the nude groupings by Ingres and Picasso presume a male viewer as, at the least, the artists themselves were males. Lempicka subverts that dynamic and, in a way, excludes male viewers altogether."

        "description": "[i]Mr. and Mrs. William Hallett[/i] (1785) also known as [i]The Morning Walk[/i] is a double full-length portrait of William Hallett and Elizabeth Stephen, painted ahead of their wedding on July 30, 1785. The handsome young couple is seen arm-in-arm strolling on their morning walk with a Pomeranian sheepdog. They are dressed in elegant frocks, possibly their wedding clothes. This type of portrait, which presented the sitters in a natural setting dressed up in their finest garments, was fashionable among wealthy patrons in the late 18th century. Such paintings were a powerful status symbol, signifying the couple\u2019s wealth and social status. \n\nIn terms of style, Gainsborough drew inspiration from the works of his predecessors,  [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/antoine-watteau]Jean-Antoine Watteau[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Anthony van Dyck[/url]. The painting is characterized by Gainsborough\u2019s light feathery brushwork, which was typical of his late style. This is most visible in the treatment of Mrs. Hallett\u2019s dress and the dog\u2019s thick soft coat. The artist creates a sense of lightness and movement, his slanting brushstrokes in the sky and foliage give the impression of a light breeze. Similarly, Elizabeth\u2019s gauzy shawl and her husband\u2019s hair almost blend into the landscape as the pair walks through. In this way, Gainsborough gave the portrait a delicate, poetic quality, which is described sometimes as a \u2018lingering fragrance\u2019. The painting was interpreted by some as a universal statement about wedding bliss, showing a young couple as they set out on their life journey together.\n\nWilliam Hallett was the grandson of a wealthy cabinet market. After the death of his grandfather in 1781, he inherited his villa and estate at Canons and Middlesex. Like many upper-class young men of the era, he went on the Grand Tour, traveling for two years through Europe. Upon his return, he married Elizabeth Stephen, the daughter of James Stephen, a wealthy surgeon who died before her marriage. Both the bride and groom were 21 when they got married at the richly decorated church of St Lawrence, Little Stanmore. The couple had six children in total, two sons and four daughters. In his will, William wrote that he lived with his wife Elizabeth \u2018most happily for nearly 48 years, as it was impossible to do otherwise with such a woman\u2019.\n\nNevertheless, Elizabeth\u2019s life was probably a difficult one as her husband had a gambling problem which ultimately led to his downfall. By 1830, William\u2019s habit of betting on horses and his poor business choices had caught up with him, and his entire fortune was squandered. Elizabeth died at the age of 69, and shortly after William remarried. According to his will, William had lost most of his fortune and had little to leave to his children. However, in the will he mentions a painting: \u2018my picture of my late wife\u2026 painted before I married July 30th, 1785\u2019, most likely Gainsborough\u2019s painting, that he gave to his daughter Lettice Elizabeth.\n\nFor the last 60 years, [i]Mr. and Mrs. William Hallett[/i] has been part of the National Gallery collection in London. In 2017, a man attacked the painting with a screwdriver, making two large scratches on the canvas. Fortunately, the damage was not extensive, and the painting was restored and rehung in the Museum within 10 days."

Marie Laurencin was by then constantly mingling animals and humans, and here represents a white poodle sitting on the model's knees. On the right-hand side of the painting, another dog is leaping towards a turtle dove which appears to be descending from the sky towards Coco Chanel, like the dove of the Holy Spirit, perhaps a symbol of freedom? The soft harmony of the colours - green, blue and pink - is reinforced by the long black line of the scarf draped around the model's neck.\nChanel did not appreciate the portrait and refused to buy it from Marie Laurencin. The latter, furious, was unwilling to paint a second portrait and kept the original.\n\n[url href=https://www.musee-orangerie.fr/en/artworks/portrait-de-mademoiselle-chanel-196418]Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie[/url]"

        "description": "In the late 1990s the National Gallery, London commissioned twenty-four artists from Europe and North America to produce work in response to the gallery's collection. \"Hemingway Never Ate Here\", which was Patrick Caulfield's contribution to the exhibition, takes as its central motif A Cup of Water and a Rose on a Silver Plate, c.1630 (National Gallery, London) by the Spanish seventeenth century painter Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n (1598-1664). The motif reappears in Zurbar\u00e1n's Still Life with Basket of Oranges, 1633 (The Norton Simon Foundation, Pasadena). Though Caulfield had always admired the Spanish still life paintings in the National Gallery, his choice was partly determined by his wish to celebrate his son's recent marriage to a Spaniard.\r\nWhile it is probable that Zurbar\u00e1n considered the simple composition of his still life paintings as an expression of divine order and that the objects in them have religious significance (clear water and the rose are both symbols associated with the purity and holiness of the Virgin Mary), Caulfield has stated that his primary interest in this painting lies in its formal simplicity, and not in its Christian undercurrents. Although he has meticulously rendered the cup of water and the silver plate as they appear in Zurbar\u00e1n's painting, the flower has been replaced by a segment of lime. To the right he intended to paint a designer beer with a lime wedge in its neck, but chose a tonic bottle because it was shorter and thus would not break the line of the dado rail above. Since the late 1980s the practice of inserting lime wedges into beer bottles has often come to serve as a fashionable mark of Hispanic culture.\r\nThe bull's head, painted from an actual stuffed head that Caulfield hired in London, was included after he visited a bar off the Plaza Mayor in Madrid in 1998 where a similar one was hung. During the same trip he discovered a bar bearing the inscription 'Hemingway never ate here', a wry recommendation in a city dotted with bars claiming to have served the famous American writer. Ernest Hemingway's evocations of Spain in such books as Fiesta contributed to a national stereotype characterised by noble matadors and hard drinking.\r\nCaulfield's play with signs of cultural identity is matched by his use of pictorial conventions. The high realism evident in the rendering of the bull's head and the still life objects is juxtaposed with a heavily reductive and flat background. While the realist elements command stable spatial positions, the rest of the interior is ambiguous spatially. The relation of the round table with the still life objects to the wall behind is difficult to establish, as is the means by which the table is supported. Likewise how the room through the archway connects with the foreground is not resolved. In the upper left a scroll made from a length of sash cord has been applied to the canvas surface and painted green. As with Interior with a Picture, 1985-6 (Tate T07112) where an oval motif is formed from three thick lines of acrylic paint squeezed direct from the tube, Caulfield points out the artifice of pictorial space by introducing a real three-dimensional object into the painting. The exploration of real and artificial is a central theme in his investigation into painting and culture."

Behind them, a female nurse stands at attention, presumably waiting to assist in the operation. Rows of seated male medical students watch the surgery. The white clothes of the doctors, the sheets covering a part of the patient's body, as well as her pale skin stand in sharp contrast to the dark tones in which the students are painted.\n\nThis painting marks the second time Eakins took as his subject a doctor teaching and performing surgery in a medical school setting. Once again, the stark and often gritty Realism for which he is best known is present in this work, but when compared with his earlier painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-eakins/the-gross-clinic-1875][i]The Gross Clinic[/i][/url] (1875), we can see a different, perhaps even more mature, approach to the subject matter. The work is notably awash in light that helps to draw the viewer to the action of the surgery. A heightened element of drama is created by choice of surgery depicted. While Dr. Agnew was a specialist in this type of operation, a mastectomy was, to the general public, a shocking and scary surgery of which little was still known. The fact that it had a high fatality rate imbues the scene with a more serious tone. Eakins placed himself in the crowd of students (on the far right of the canvas), but the inclusion of a female nurse, modeled on the first nurse graduate from the university's program, is unique to this work. Dr. Agnew, familiar with the earlier painting of Dr. Gross, insisted on not being painted with blood on his hands, as surgeons were too often associated with butchers.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine students commissioned the portrait as a gift for Dr. D. Hayes Agnew, who was retiring at the end of the term. They had wanted a simple portrait of the doctor, but Eakins created a more elaborate scene at no extra fee. The successful reception of the work when it was unveiled at the school's graduation, which included a standing ovation, buoyed the artist's spirits, and set the stage for a successful, albeit not scandal-free, later career. Despite the rejection of the work from a Society of American Artists show, a slight which led to Eakins severing all ties with the organization, it was well-received when first shown to a large public at the Chicago World's Columbian Exhibition in 1893."

        "description": "This is the only completed easel painting that William Morris produced. It is a portrait of Jane Burden, Morris's soon-to-be wife, and it is believed that he started work on it very early during their courtship. The picture has been identified in the past as [i]Queen Guenevere[/i], partly owing to the fact that Morris published his first volume of poetry, [i]The Defence of Guenevere[/i], in March 1858. However, recent research has established convincingly that the picture is intended to represent Iseult mourning Tristram's exile from the court of King Mark.\n\nThe story of [i]Tristram and Iseult[/i] (Tristan and Isolde) is a legend of Celtic origin made famous during the medieval period by the treatment of Thomas Mallory, on which Morris based his composition. Iseult appears to have recently arisen from her bed, where a small greyhound lies curled up among the crumpled sheets. She stands wistfully in her small chamber, her feelings for Tristram reinforced by the sprigs of rosemary, symbolizing remembrance, in her crown, and the word [i]'DOLOURS[/i]' (grief) written down the side of her mirror.\n\nThe rich colors, the emphasis on pattern, and details such as the illuminated missal reveal where Morris's true talents lay. He was less at home with figure painting than with illumination, embroidery, and woodcarving, and he struggled for months on this picture. Many of the furnishings, such as the Turkish rug, Persian embroidered cover, and whitework hangings on the bed, were probably in Morris's personal collection. \n\nThe narrative of doomed lovers contains all the aspects of Medieval romance - thwarted desire, virtue, honor, chivalry - that attracted the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood]Pre-Raphaelites[/url] to the literature and art of the period. In the scene depicted, Iseult is mourning the exile of Tristram - a knight sent to fetch her from Ireland to marry King Mark of Cornwall, only for the two to fall in love en route - from her husband's court. The tale was one that Morris had previously represented in the Oxford Union Murals, and the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite artists with whom he undertook that project, particularly [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti]Rossetti[/url], is evident. At the same time, we might trace a thread of affinity with the nascent [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/symbolism]Symbolist[/url] movement in continental Europe, given the heavily allegorical nature of the composition. The dog on the bed, given to Iseult by Tristram in Mallory's story, stands for loyalty, the rosemary in her crown for remembrance.\n\nThe painting also alludes in various ways to Morris's artistic and personal biography. While figural painting would never be his true calling, we can sense clues as to his future endeavors as a designer and craftsman in the finer details of the scene. On the bed is an illuminated manuscript similar to those Morris would produce with Kelmscott Press. At the same time, the lavish textiles and tapestries are reminiscent of those Morris would spend most of his career creating. As for his model, Jane's strong, striking features, which epitomized the Pre-Raphaelite ideal of beauty, also caught the attention of Morris's friend and mentor Rossetti, with whom Jane embarked on a lifelong affair, grudgingly tolerated by her husband."

The mural, comprised of ten canvas panels, surveys the broad scope of American life throughout the 1920s. Eight of the ten panels depict life in different geographical regions of the United States: the South, the Midwest, the West, and New York. These dense compositions show the contemporary life of the masses, and especially labor. The panels demonstrate the diversity of labor in America: cotton pickers (Georgia and Louisiana); farmers in wheat fields (Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma); coal miners (Alabama, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia); workers in steel plants (Maryland) and construction workers (New York). Even when depicting recreational activities in the panel [i]City Activities with Dance Hall[/i], Benton paints \u201ctaxi dancers\u201d, women who dance with their male partners for ten cents a ticket. \n\nDuring the 1920s, Benton traveled throughout these areas of the country, creating an extensive number of sketches, which were the basis for America Today: \u201cEvery head is a real person, drawn from life. Every detail is a thing I have seen and known.\u201d In the next phase, Benton created a clay model of the mural to establish the rhythm and flow of the composition. This practice was common among old masters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tintoretto]Tintoretto[/url], and Benton adopted it as early as 1919. The artist\u2019s dynamic figurative style derived from his admiration for Tintoretto and other 16th-century [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/mannerism-late-renaissance]Mannerist[/url] painters. At the same time, he was influenced by more contemporary sources such as early 20th-century film sets, and his depictions of architecture are reminiscent of the works of Italian painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-de-chirico]Giorgio de Chirico[/url].\n\nIn [i]America today[/i], Benton explores the idea of progress by tracing the emergence of industrialization and its impact on American life. The largest panel, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-hart-benton/instruments-of-power-1931][i]Instruments of Power[/i][/url] displays the power of modern machinery, symbolizing the process of industrialization and modern progress. For Benton, the idea of progress is tied to the development of modern technology, which in turn is dependent on manual and industrial labor. He expresses this in the strong bodies of heroic workers that appear throughout the mural. Although the concept of progress is celebrated in America today the artist also included the negative impacts of industrialization in the mural. The clearest examples of these can be found in the two panels that depict urban life. In [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-hart-benton/city-activities-with-subway-1931][i]City Activities with Subway[/i][/url], behind the Salvation Army band, storefronts display signs of closing businesses and bargain sales. Similarly, in [i]City Activities with Dance Hall[/i], there is a worried stockbroker that watches the market returns on a ticker tape machine. Benton painted the mural at a time of great economic despair and inequity of the Great Depression, that began in 1929. The smallest panel, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-hart-benton/outreaching-hands-1931][i]Outreaching Hands[/i][/url] alludes to the breadlines of the Great Depression by showing only hands reaching for bread and other hands holding money.\n\nIn 1984, the mural was acquired by the insurance company AXA, and after restoration, it was displayed at the company headquarters in New York City. In 2012, the mural was renovated, and subsequently, the company decided to donate the work to the Metropolitan Museum in New York City."

A rear-admiral under Hawke in 1759, Geary had the misfortune to miss the Quiberon Bay action that November. In May 1780 he succeeded to the command of the Channel fleet on the death of Sir Charles Hardy, during a critical period of threatened French invasion, but was forced to give up the command for health reasons the following August. In this painting he stands on the battery at Portsmouth, with the fleet anchored in the left background including the 'Victory', 100 guns, as his flagship. Both the background and the ships are believed to be by Dominic Serres. There is a modern inscription in the left foreground.\r\n\r\nThe artist was an important portrait painter of the late eighteenth century, generally ranked third after Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. He was in Paris in 1764 and in 1773 moved to Italy for two years, where he became interested in history paintings in the elevated and \u00e9litist 'Grand Manner'. This developed into improving upon nature and the pursuit of perfect form. At its best his work demonstrated refinement, sensitivity and elegance, although it could also be repetitive and monotonous. As a society painter he typified late-eighteenth-century English artists who, compelled by the conditions of patronage to spend their time in producing portraits, could only aspire to imaginative and ideal painting. By 1780 Romney's portraits, according to Horace Walpole, were 'in great vogue' and he worked in an increasingly neo-classical style."

Each flower, as well as the woman's face, are painted with an extreme accuracy, the colors used are sweet and some melancholy emanates from the scene. The look of the young woman seems to contain a hint of seriousness.\r\n\r\nThe painting was notably exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1845 and at the Exposition Universelle (1855), also in Paris, among other exhibitions. It was restored in 1974.\r\n\r\nLarousse Encyclopedia describes this work as \"well-balanced\". However, it is unclear if the painting is the portrait of a woman known by Janmot, but the clothes she wears do not comply with her time, but recall the portraits of the Italian Renaissance. This may be a painting of flowers, as this type of art was very popular in Lyon in the 19th century. But perhaps the young woman is she the goddess Flora and is a thought about the transience of time."

        "description": "[i]Dolly Sisters[/i] is a fine example of Kees van Dongen\u2019s society period, known as the \u201cCocktail Age\u201d when the painter was at the height of his fame and success. In the aftermath of the First World War, his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Fauvist[/url], anarchist style had softened and he had become a vital player on the Parisian social scene. The portrait became virtually his only subject and he painted countless depictions of the great names of this fashionable world, be they personalities from the arts, entertainment, finance or European aristocracy.\n\nWhen he painted the present work, Van Dongen was living with his partner Jasmy Jacob, who ran the couture house in a sumptuous private mansion on the Rue Juliette-Lamber. This street became one of the most well-trodden in all of Paris, as it was here that Van Dongen would organise his celebrated preview parties, exhibiting the many portraits he painted at this time. At these [i]soir\u00e9es[/i], a colourful mix of people would rub shoulders, from society women in evening dresses, to cabaret singers, actresses, dancers and politicians. Van Dongen himself described the unusual mix in these terms: \u201c[i]The world is a big garden, full of flowers, full of weeds [\u2026]. In today\u2019s pleasure garden, everything can be stirred together and blended: this is the Cocktail Age[/i]\u201d.\n\nIn 1925, the year of the present work, Van Dongen not only enjoyed a prestigious personal exhibition at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune but also organised no less than three exhibitions at his home on the Rue Juliette-Lamber (one in May, one in September and one from 15th November to 15th December), and though the photographs of these functions have unfortunately disappeared, we can nevertheless assume that [i]Dolly Sisters [/i]would have been presented at one of these three illustrious events.\n\nThe painting depicts two of the most striking personalities of the music hall world of the 1920s. The Dolly Sisters, whose real names were Rose and Jenny Dolly, were true celebrities of Parisian nightlife when they were painted by Van Dongen in 1925. The twin sisters, who were actresses and dancers, had found fame the decade before in the USA. After the First World War, they purchased a [i]chateau[/i] in France and performed in a series of highly successful tours across Europe. Their most famous show, [i]A Vol d\u2019oiseau[/i], was a headliner for eight years in Paris. Renowned not only for their talent as dancers but also for their lavish weddings,  relationships with wealthy men, their love of sport and racing and their sumptuous collection of jewellery, these two sisters perfectly summed up the world of the [i]Ann\u00e9e Folles[/i] that Van Dongen so loved to depict.\n\nThis painting is one of a series of portraits of celebrities from the world of show-business, including the opera singer [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/kees-van-dongen/mademoiselle-genevieve-vix-dans-le-role-de-salome-1920][i]Mademoiselle Genevi\u00e8ve Vix dans le r\u00f4le de Salom\u00e9[/i][/url] (1920), famous mime artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/kees-van-dongen/maria-ricotti-dans-l-enjoleuse-1921][i]Maria Ricotti dans L\u2019Enj\u00f4leuse[/i][/url] (1921), the statuesque music-hall singer [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/kees-van-dongen/portrait-of-suzy-solidor-1927][i]Suzy Solidor[/i][/url] (1927) who would star in the film [i]La Gar\u00e7onne[/i], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/kees-van-dongen/lactrice-paulette-pax-1918][i]Paulette Pax[/i][/url] (1918) who would go on to play Joan of Arc, and not forgetting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/kees-van-dongen/lactrice-lili-damita-1926][i]Lili Damita[/i][/url] (1926), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/kees-van-dongen/josephine-baker-1925][i]Jos\u00e9phine Baker[/i][/url] (1925) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/kees-van-dongen/arletty-1931][i]Arletty[/i][/url] (1931). The d\u00e9cor used for this painting, with the two sisters seated on a green velour armchair, is also the same used for several other portraits from this era, proving that the sittings did indeed take place in the painter\u2019s studio on the Rue Juliette-Lamber.\n\nIn this portrait, as in others from this period, Van Dongen demonstrates remarkable mastery of color and light. The bright tones of his Fauvist period have given way to a more measured palette, in which greens, blues and greys replace the incandescent reds and oranges of his early years. His painting nevertheless retains its expressiveness; the green shadows on the faces giving the models an otherworldly charm. The painter skillfully deploys electric lights to highlight the bodies and faces, in the manner of a cinematographer. Far from conventional naturalism, Van Dongen manages to create a visual vocabulary conducive to recreating the atmosphere of those festive years that he so enjoyed, describing them in these terms: \u201c[i]I passionately love the life of my own time, so animated, so frenzied.[/i] [\u2026] [i]Yes, I love things that shine, precious stones that sparkle, fabric that shimmers, beautiful women that inspire carnal desire\u2026 and painting gives me complete possession of all of that, for what I paint is often the obsessive realisation of a dream or a fixation.[/i]\u201d\n\n[i]from [url href=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/art-impressionniste-moderne-pf1506/lot.22.html]Sotheby's catalogue note[/url][/i]"

        "description": "Building the Boat, Tr\u00e9boul is characteristic of Christopher Wood's style and methods in the last months of his life. Inspired by the example of Vincent Van Gogh, he explored rural and natural themes in search of a retreat from his troubles. The painted surface is thickly worked using energetically applied primer, the strokes of which are visible and unrelated to the final image. As was his practice, the main image was established first and the background painted around it. This means that the priming is still visible in the green of the sea to the left and in the houses on the hill. Last and thickest of all was the eggshell blue of the sky.\r\nThe composition is carefully conceived and derived from the actual presence of a boat being built beside the port, confirmed by a closely related canvas, The New Boat, Tr\u00e9boul, which shows the boat in the same state of construction. Unexpectedly, an old woman holds a plank. This use of the unconventional seems to indicate that the painter found some particular significance in the gesture. He dressed the woman in black and made her the focus of the foreground and of the gossip of her companions behind. The impression of mourning is forceful and the way she hugs the wood suggests consolation. The implications of concerns with mortality are consistent both with the subject and with the period in which the canvas was painted.\r\nBeside Wood's few companions in Brittany that summer, one of the first people to see his output was the dealer Lucy Wertheim. She was preparing a show of his work to open her London gallery and travelled to Paris especially to see his latest paintings. She recalled: \"My first feeling as Kit placed a large new canvas on the easel in front of me was one of dismay. I had got so used to the sombre depth and colouring of the paintings I now owned by him ... that this new mood in which he was painting came to me as something of a shock.\" The contrast with the more hallucinogenic works which she owned was indeed marked.\r\nUnlike her, Jim Ede favoured the fresh and the apparently innocent side of Wood's work, though he was of course aware of their darker side. In A Way of Life he wrote of Building the Boat, Tr\u00e9boul: \"skeletons of ships in process of being built, which foreshadow the skeletons of the fishermen who would take them out to sea and not return. Wives and mothers, who had sent their husbands and their sons, help a younger generation to build new ships of death. I see this in his thought since he wrote of it in a letter. How pictorially he has visualized it; without a shade of sentimentality.\" Ede owned the painting by 1932, having presumably acquired it in the division of the artist's estate in late 1930. He had made some attempt to interest the Tate Trustees in Wood's work, but remarked that the painter was considered \"consciously na\u00efve and not inevitably so\" within the institution."

The subject, however, did not come easily to her.\r\n\r\n\"I tried that interior but did not like it, so I erased it,\" she noted on one occasion. \"That don't seem to be in my line. I like to paint something that leads me on and on into the unknown, something that I want to see away on beyond. Well, maybe I try again.\"\r\n\r\nDespite her difficulties with the subject, Moses did paint a number of striking interiors. Without the landscape to anchor the scene and provide an element of realism, her interiors rely almost wholly on the artist's command of abstract form and patterning. These qualities are used to maximum advantage in The Quilting Bee, wherein the colors and forms of the large quilt and the elaborate table setting play off neatly against the bright clothing of the numerous bustling characters. Still, Moses could not resist adding a bit of nature beyond the tall, uncurtained windows."

He employed a light style that was related to his direct observation of his subject, as indicated by the lightly amused look on her face and her engaged posture. This painting is also indicative of his use of small color planes. Rather than completing the painting with realistic depth and shadow, he illustrates the figure as if she is in a singular dimension, employing the use of one color for each area of the composition. "

His influence on Israel Tsvaygenbaum is tremendous. Though the painting \u201cPeople of Derbent\u201d is dedicated to the people of his birth city Derbent (a town in Southern Russia) and the surroundings do look like the city, the people were painted based on impressions that his father gave him about Jews in Poland. Much of Israel Tsvaygenbaum childhood in this city was so closely linked with his father\u2019s stories of Poland, regardless of the difference of time, generation and culture between these two places. We can see a mixture of two lives; one of the Jews of Poland at the time of his father and the second is contemporary Derbent, two opposite worlds artist often thought about and was raised with as a child."

The painting has an enormous internal energy. The crossing diagonals forming the borders of the fields and the ploughed furrows, the contours of the roofs, the row of cypresses - such vectors strain the composition, but not so much as to disturb the unity of the whole. It is a study from nature. The colouring of the painting and the action of the figures show us that it was executed in autumn, a time when Van Gogh worked not only on the hospital grounds, but outside them as well."

        "description": "Free thought on artistic intuitions: expression, form and synthesis of art in the early works of Paolo Salvati\nGet in touch with Paolo Salvati\u2019s work means giving yourself over to the extraordinary intuitive beauty of art. The philosopher Benedetto Croce stated that making art is an event that expresses the intuitive intensity of the artist who acts in freedom following the art\u2019s intrinsic spiritual principle that presides over the constituent process.\nAt the beginning of the mid-seventies, however, artists faced the first expressive and of content obstacles determined by the new market rules and its governance.\nPaolo Salvati, the undisputed master of modern art and the chromatic exponent of the second Roman Expressionism, immediately became aware of the impoverishment of art caused by art market and economic interests and the relative consequences on purity and exceptionality of artworks.\nUnlike the contemporary artistic scenario, the Roman artist\u2019s works focused on the personal and clear declaration of intent since the seventies.\nArt as a narrator of man and the world departs from its function and fulfils the \"commercial\" needs, incorporating into a consumerist and globalized mechanism the tendencies of the artisans of the trade. Few artists resist to the temptation and are firmly anchored to the pure and intrinsic end of \"making art\", they tell about man in a deeply intimate sense, they are the Great Masters, rare fireflies in a deformed artistic contemporary. The price to pay for not submitting to the modern market is certainly the definitive exclusion from the critics and connoisseurs\u2019 \"showcase\", dedicating their own work to the few followers of the pure art.\nPaolo Salvati strongly wanted to defend his integrity as an artist and as a man so decided to protect his work from the modern nuances of art. In fact, in the last years of his production he affirmed that \"too much late history becomes aware of its great Masters. History is made up of men who often are inadequate at the task assigned\".\nPaolo Salvati was a Great Master, he was discovered late by critics and art makers, but first of all he was a Great Man, in its profound sense of meaning, and his production tells the intimate thoughts of a great soul that found refuge in the art in order to give voice to its essence.\nAccording to the American painter Jackson Pollock (Cody, 28 January 1912 - Long Island, 11 August 1956), \"painting is self-discovery process\" and \"every good artist paints what he is\". It is undisputed that Paolo Salvati shared Pollock\u2019s opinion, he is one of the leading exponents of abstract expressionism and action painting, author of one of the most interesting and controversial pages of the history of modern American art. For the Roman author, in fact, in a present permeated of \"artistic subculture\", art represents the safe place in which expressing our own freedom, a favorite background in which representing through colour the most personal self-portrait.\nA long introduction to a pleasant journey among some early works of the great Roman Master. An exciting journey through the colours and emotions of Paolo Salvati that I would like to inaugurate with a work of 1974, significant for the title and for the clear expression of the colour palette. Evasione di un\u2019artista (Escapism of an artist) oil on canvas, 60x70 cm, 1974, is a prelude to the chromatic vivacity and expressive serenity of Paolo Salvati's latest production.\nComposition, unquiet line and chromatics, indefinite context recall the most important work of Edvard Munch, symbolist and precursor of Expressionism. The Norwegian painter had a difficult life, particularly filled with spiritual distress. In he 1893 painted The Scream, a work which was introduced in the series The frieze of life which explores the main human themes: life, love, fear, death, melancholy, and anxiety. Every aspect is investigated in composition, in design as in chromatic rendering. A raw investigation with no nuances which confirms the caducity and finitude of the human condition. The man and artist Paolo Salvati, dramatically convinced of the \"defeat of color\u201d and \u201cartistic intensity\" required by contemporary art which is meteor generator and poor of great masters, in An artist's escape he had to face himself, hoping for the\nultimate regeneration of the soul with the infinite, crossing the physical data of human nature and looking to an imminent and necessary transcendent, merely expressed by purple on the sky horizon. The work defines the condition of deep anxiety and sense of uncertainty experienced by those who decide not to compromise with the rules of an increasingly impersonal present, deciding to safeguard their inner integrity.\nPaolo Salvati took the first step towards a new breath for the soul in three different works linked by symbolism: Montagne Blu su Fronde Rosse (Blue Mountain on Red Fronds) 2003, Montagna Gialla (Yellow Montain) 1991 and Pietra Blu (Blu Stone) 2000-2008. It is appropriate to make a comparison with one of the first series painted by Paolo Salvati, and certainly one of the most intimately felt and experienced. From 1973 the Roman painter began experimenting colour by painting a canvas with a large central stone, angular and blue, surrounded by a wild and tormented landscape. It is the life journey of every single man made of obstacles to overcome and challenges to face passing through impervious and dangerous paths. In his first works of the series we clearly read the weight of human existence consisting of love, joys, labors, pains and tears which we must necessarily live and face to reach the awareness of a transcendent and ultimate serenity.\nBlue Stone\u2019s theme develops into the Mountains\u2019 series, strongly influenced by the chromatic spectacle of the Red Fronds\u2019s series. Paolo Salvati\u2019s nineties works seem to echo his words, he was convinced that \"even today the colour is the [..] true and only friend, who [..] consoles without ever reproaching me\".\nThe tones became delicate, the landscapes soft, and the skies were filled with light. The work is charged with expressive poetry, the weight of existence has been addressed and incorporated into a feeling of ethereal peace. The chains of suffering and pain melt, reaching the awareness that, as the American writer Richard Bach states, \"each of us is in truth, an image of a great seagull, an infinite idea of freedom, without limits\".\nPaolo Salvati did not bend to the market\u2019s rules, maintaining his integrity as a man and as an artist, and he opposed to the defeat of colour operated in contemporary art by taking refuge in colour itself, the only tool which gives material and visual concreteness to soul\u2019s freedom and to the personal idea of art.\nTranscendent atmospheres, on the other hand, characterize the series of dreams: Sogno di Primavera d\u2019alta montagna (Dream of High Mountain Spring), 1974; Sogno d\u2019estate (Summer Dream), 1975; Sogni di Primavera, 1994 (Dreams of Spring) that carry spectator\u2019s eye in a deep inner stillness.\nThe canvas is prepared to welcome a cascade of colour where the images take shape. Images just sketched where the theme of the seasons is the narrator of dreams. They are inner dreams, expressions of the ultimate peace reached by the Great Master who, although exhausted by the innumerable obstacles imposed by life, found in the colour breath and valid refuge, where he can be himself, without wearing masks.\nOil colours and canvas are for Paolo Salvati the inkwell and parchment for the poet, instruments designed to create poetry, the artist through colour, the poet through words. In these works the influence of Impressionism is evident especially in comparison with the series Ninfee, dreams of aquatic landscapes painted by Claude Monet since 1909. In these works the impressionist artist's eye is completely absorbed by the vibrant colour game that these flowers, together with the sky, create on the water\u2019s surface which becomes almost the main theme. Likewise, Paolo Salvati in painting the series of Sogni (Dreams) lets himself get carried away by the game of reflections that sunlight creates on nature paying attention to the smallest detail. As the impressive technique of painting en plain air, the Roman artist began from observation to create an image permeated with sensations and impressions, making the theme of the dream the language through which speaking the unconscious perceptions emerged during the life\u2019s journey.\nLooking at the indecipherable colors, nature, dreams and horizons, the stream of consciousness on Paolo Salvati\u2019s works ends with three paintings that portray human presence, albeit sketched, in the context of art. A house and a village tell us about people, a subject hardly represented in his art. It is in fact through\nnature and its own colours that Paolo Salvati loves to describe the transience of human existence and the state of mind people feel during their life.\nIn Dalla Pastorale (From Pastoral) 1976, Village (Paese) (1978) and Invented Landscape (Paesaggio inventato) 2008, the house is representation of human presence, ideologically interpreted as a nest, shelter, beating heart of everyday life, a place where the day begins and ends. Home as a sense of belonging, a home as a home, a home as a family, a home as a sense of self. However in his works the human element is just mentioned, a weak presence dominated by the chromatic triumph of the nature that surrounds it.\nDreamlike dimension which embellishes the drawing, soft lines underlining the absolute stillness at the foundation of the artist's sensory digressions, pastel shades rendering self narrative into chromatic terms.\nPaolo Salvati\u2019s intention to remain faithful to his artistic language and not submit to the contemporary market\u2019s rules obliged him to accept the exclusion of his art, too powerful and not malleable by the fake gurus of art that since the seventies modified the specifications through which give meaning to art. The great Master, therefore, found himself isolated, deciding that his works will communicate his personal message to future generation. In fact From Pastoral and the Invented Landscape testified the artist\u2019s serene abandonment of artistic solitude, aware that he will not be able to enjoy the appreciation of his works as masterpieces, but intimately sure that in the future his art can have justice. History, like all the sciences, is governed by laws, universal principles that are constantly repeated in the same way and which, as attested by the Italian philosopher, historian and jurist, Giambattista Vico in the seventeenth century, are the reference point for the birth and the maintenance of nations.\nPaolo Salvati was profoundly convinced of this, and this certainty is preserved in the extraordinary range of colours of the two paintings, which tell the integrity of a great man and artist who, despite his loneliness, fiercely maintains his language and his artistic creed. Village, oil on canvas painted in 1978, is certainly the work that best expresses the profound meaning of abandonment. An image permeated with expressionism, the artistic movement in which Paolo Salvati was one of the cornerstone. After directly observing an image the artist elaborates it in every facet swayed by his feeling, creating a drawing that expresses the more intimate and profound sensations perceived through the observation of reality. The immediate image is that of a small village abandoned by its inhabitants, in the inevitable exodus towards the cities and towards the hope of a better future. It remains a private reality of its fuel, man and his daily life, steeped in the memory of the past and destined to a progressive death.\nWe see a long and narrow street flanked by low buildings. A road that turns towards an indecipherable and indefinite horizon. In the foreground the nature in the form of disordered bushes and a tree where only the trunk is visible. The lines and the colour recall the Blue Tree and Blue Stone series, a visual demonstration of Paolo Salvati's most intimate belief.\nVillage expresses the sense of abandonment felt by the man and artist Paolo Salvati towards a contemporary situation that speaks a language too different from his own. The Great Man and the Great Master are described in the same scene, symbolically represented by the blue tree in the foreground, ready to face a journey towards a destination that only the path can discover. It is a sensory and mental journey rather than physical trip, discovering the Self and looking for answers to the atavistic questions of the human being: who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we destined? Rather than gave defined answers to questions we all have, Paolo Salvati allowed his work to be the medium by which his answers will be appreciated by future generations.\nPier Paolo Pasolini, the essential signature of the twentieth century's artistic history, stated that \"My independence, which is my strength, implies loneliness, which is my weakness\". Paolo Salvati, through his art, managed to transform the weakness of solitude into extraordinary expressive power, able today to count and recognize the great Master among the main authors of contemporary art history. The art of Paolo Salvati is a journey across the heart of life and hope because \"Living without hope means giving up living\" (Fedor Dostoevskij).\n\nArt historian, Dr. Giada Boasso\nTurin, May 2016"

Chirtani, in particular, noted how the canvas was imposed by the careful chromatic orchestration that was based, in a musical parallel, on three different registers: that of the vivid and saturated colors of the foreground, that of the half voices that make up the average vox on which the sound rings are inserted, and that of the \"damping\" given by the decrease in intensity of the tones in depth."

Drawn from studies of anatomical drawings and Eadweard Muybridge's motion photography, Two Figures is as much an exploration of the body in action as it is a representation of the physical act of love. The two figures entwined in bed are covered by Bacon's \"curtain\" of striated lines, which both obstructs the view and enhances the movement of the figures. Instead of evoking the romance of a nighttime rendezvous, the dark colors of the painting allude to a more sinister encounter."

The two engage in a playful tug-of-war, and the girl's resistance to Eros appears minimal. As her veil falls, her innocent appearance takes on a semi-unintentional sexual appeal, adding to the painting's voyeuristic allure.\n\nThis work exemplifies Bouguereau's classical and mythological scenes infused with sensuality. While they sold well with a new market of wealthy American buyers, they were often ridiculed by his Impressionist contemporaries. Some critics and artists even accused Bouguereau of being a lecherous painter preoccupied with female nudes and devaluing the legacy of his Renaissance predecessors, such as Raphael, by producing cheap, erotic imitations of their work.\n\nHowever, stylistically and thematically, this painting is not as straightforwardly clich\u00e9 as it may appear. The landscape depicted in the background is based on contemporary France, likely the rural south, where Bouguereau spent many of his formative years. Therefore, the work offers a superficially modernized approach to its subject matter. Furthermore, Bouguereau's skillful mastery of the human form and subtle tonal contrasts is evident in the painting."

        "description": "[i][/i]John Currin's Gezellig is an important painting that forms part of his recent series inspired by pornographic imagery. The dramtatic foreshortening of this composition is designed to challenge the viewer to look up at the figure's face, the usual first point of call in observing humans in real life or representations. Yet the eye is continually confronted with the figure's nakedness and undulating expanse of creamy white flesh that eventually leads to a detached expression. In this delightfully perverse painting, Currin cunningly recruits the viewer into this perspective, which is at once shocking and arousing. \n\nControversial and driven by his own unique vision, Currin has been heralded as one of the most important artists of his generation and in the powerful position of re-directing people back to discussions of painting's relevance. With Gezellig he appears to play on the idea of painting as fetish object, doomed to be a victim of the lustful, objectifying male voyeur, while humorously re-casting the subject of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Gustav Courbet[/url]'s erotic masterpiece [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet/the-origin-of-the-world-1866][i]L'Origine du monde[/i][/url] (1866) as a slightly bored, middle-class intellectual.\n\nA further clue to understanding Currin's fusion of serious painterly concerns with imagery that courts the absurd lies in the titles of his works. Many of the porn inspired paintings are named after the places and people of Northern Europe, including [i]Rotterdam, Copenhagen, Malm\u00f6,[i] and [/i]The Danes[/i]. [i]Gezellig[/i] itself takes its title from a Dutch word meaning cozy, friendly, or relaxing. Such references draw a connection to the stereotype of permissive sexual attitudes in these countries. They also hint at a kernel of the idea that prompted Currin to begin the series in the first place, namely the Muhammad cartoon controversy that was unfolding in Northern Europe at the time they were painted. Currin's reaction to the debate about free expression was to present a kind of satire of a libertine socialist Europe through the medium of pornography. But ultimately this complex argument was put aside as an excuse to make beautiful paintings full of animation and the delicate textures and hues of warm, naked skin.\n\nCurrin recognizes that porn as a subject matter is loaded with clich\u00e9: from its tired photographic conventions, to the standard condemnation of its sexist values, to its frequent use in art as a symbol of personal liberation. Currin's conceptual program involves assimilating the inherent corruption of this visual system and re-presenting it in a traditionally elevated form to not only disturb society's, and more specifically the art world's, established taboos, but also to reinvigorate his medium and the genre of figurative painting in general."

        "description": "This captivating Portrait of Plato (as indicated by his name inscribed along the top of the canvas), a perfect example of Luca Giordano\u2019s early work, takes its place among the formidable gallery of idealised portraits \u2013 among them several series of philosophers \u2013 painted by the great Neapolitan artist in the footsteps of his teacher Jusepe de Ribera. The subject of ancient philosophers became widespread in Italy, the Low Countries and France, reflecting an interest in Neo-Stoicism. In 1630 Ribera had already painted four such figures for the Duke of Alcal\u00e1, and in 1636 he received a commission from Prince Karl Eusebius von Liechtenstein for a series of twelve (of which six were still in the family collection until the end of the 1950s).\r\n\r\nWith his left hand, Plato points to a mirror, steadied on a table with his other hand. The mirror reflects his hand and the side of the table bears the following inscription: \u201cLa pi\u00f9 gran vitoria / che possa havere / un\u2019uomo \u00e8 vincere / s\u00e9 stesso\u201d. This is translation of a passage from Plato\u2019s Laws (I.626) in which Clinias, a Cretan, tells an Athenian that \u201cthe victory over self is of all victories the first and best\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis Portrait of Plato is datable to about 1660, when Luca Giordano\u2019s handling became lighter than it had been in his earliest period, c. 1650.\r\n\r\nOur philosopher, depicted half-length, has a furrowed, grave aspect to his face, which the painter sought to convey as expressively as possible \u2013 as some have said, almost foreshadowing Goya \u2013 and the figure is shown frontally, emerging from a dark background and lit starkly. The aesthetic roots here are clearly Caravaggesque, softened by the legacy of Ribera. The latter is also the source of an emphatic naturalism: facial features marked by deep wrinkles, an unkempt white beard, a rough, half-open shirt, and an old coat sewn with long stitches \u2013 all elements that underline the links made by Neo-Stoic thinkers between philosophy and poverty. It was Socrates himself who introduced the wearing of a tribon \u2013 the bristly Greek coat worn directly over the skin.\r\n\r\nThere exist at least two other versions of this portrait: one in the Baratti collection in Naples, the other housed in the Mus\u00e9e de la Cour d\u2019Or in Metz (inv. no. II.439). To understand how much this sort of portrayal meant to Luca Giordano, one should recall that he appears as a philosopher or alchemist in several of his self-portraits. Such is the case, for instance, in the Self-Portrait as Alchemist in the Brera Gallery, Milan, of c. 1650/1653, or the Self-Portrait as Philosopher in the Bromley-Davenport collection at Capesthorne Hall, Macclesfield, Cheshire. This confirms Luca\u2019s involvement in an intellectually stimulating Neapolitan cultural climate which culminated in the creation of the Accademia degli Investiganti in 1663."

The themes of Don Quixote, those of inventiveness, quick thinking, and deception, permeated society, and have been used by many other artists and musicians, including Picasso and Strauss, including Daumier. Perhaps in Don Quixote Daumier was able to find himself in a literary hero, as he saw himself in a quixotic struggle with the society which he so loved to satirize. "

She seems childish to have lost a shoe and she tries to hide her sock with her other foot. It has been suggested that Kizette's slightly awkward position may be a reference to a well-known Russian Orthodox Christian icon of the Madonna and Child, the Theotokos of Tikhvin (c. 1300). In a highly venerated painting, the infant Jesus is holding an object, probably a scroll, and crosses one leg over the other much like Kizette does in her portrait.\n\nLempicka was quite young when she gave birth to her daughter. A major consequence of Tamara's persistent ambivalence concerning motherhood was that in general, she had very little contact with Kizette, who lived instead with close family members and attended boarding school. The girl typically saw her mother during the holidays and, according to Lempicka's biography, the artist would sometimes pretend her daughter was her sister so she could lie about her age. When the mother and daughter did meet, Lempicka would often paint Kizette's portrait. Images of Kizette are among her most successful and possibly psychologically revealing works. Indeed, in indirectly connecting Kizette to the Christ Child from the famous icon, Lempicka positions herself as the Madonna - the ideal mother- perhaps in part to assuage her guilt at essentially abandoning her child, perhaps also as a means of communicating the involuntary nature of her motherhood.\n\nAlthough this depiction of Kizette is somewhat naturalistic, the style is undoubtedly the so-called \"soft Cubism\" of Lempicka and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andr-lhote]Lhote[/url]. The girl, whose expression reflects none of the coquettishness of Lempicka's typical female subjects, seems to be sitting within an arrangement of shapes recalling industrial materials with waves, ships, and a city in the background - forms that evoke not only the sharp, fragmented shapes of Cubism but also the standard geometrical forms of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/art-deco]Art Deco[/url]."

Drawn in the schematic profile style of Egyptian hieroglyphs, a large androgynous head unites with the raised prow of a boat elaborated with breasts. The body of the vessel, directed by rudderlike legs and feet, merges at the stern with the upright body of a bird. Two powerful hands, at the ends of crossed arms, suppress the internal battle by restraining the limbs of the bird, while a third hand doggedly forges progress along the river by paddling. Thus, in keeping with the nature of much psychic conflict, a difficult internal struggle is self-contained, while the vessel-self continues along a predetermined route.\r\n\r\nNicolas Calas has suggested that Brauner was inspired by two Egyptian themes, the \u201cSun Barge\u201d and the \u201cHeavenly Vault,\u201d in the creation of this image. While a generalized Egyptian style undoubtedly influenced Brauner\u2019s imagery, it seems more likely that the artist derived this fantastic visual vocabulary from his own imagination, rather from specific art-historical sources.

Despite its smallness, the vast expanse of desolate plain and leaden sky give breadth to the scene as does the dilated perspective around the central figure of the Emperor magnified by a slightly low angle.\r\nThe least details are minutely recorded: Napoleon's sprouting beard, the veins on the horse's legs, the snow dirtied by the marching troops... the Director of the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Charles Blanc, said that Meissonier \"painted grandly in a small size\". The artist applied the same meticulous approach, but as a historian this time, to his preparatory research: he collected abundant documentation, questioned many eyewitnesses and tried unsuccessfully to borrow the Emperor's grey coat.\r\n\r\nMeissonier's approach was part of the historical realism movement which invaded painting and sculpture under the Second Empire. The episode he has chosen, although it occurred after several victories, announces forthcoming defeats. There is no action or event, just an atmosphere of loneliness and despondency. The doubts and resignation felt by the officers and the troops are palpable and are opposed to the determination that emanates from the isolated figure of Napoleon. These feelings are accentuated by the colour range: the whole scene uses brown and grey tones, subdued, deadened registers. The protagonists are not trampling virgin snow, but muddy ground.\r\n\r\nCampaign of France, 1814 is in fact the first painting of an unfinished cycle of Napoleon's conquests, which brought Meissonier great acclaim."

The gilt sofa and Mrs. Meyer's heavy, iridescent rose silk gown exude the lavishness of Louis XIV's Palace of Versailles. Sargent intentionally surrounded Mrs. Meyer with luxurious objects to emphasize her status as a member of the London elite. Following the example of the most successful Old Master portraitists, such as Van Dyck, Sargent used flattering details to highlight the sitter's best features. Placed front and center, Mrs. Meyer dominates the composition, while her children are mostly hidden behind the couch, suggesting something about their familial dynamic.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Derain and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse]Henri Matisse[/url] were the leaders of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Fauvism[/url], a groundbreaking artistic movement, which built on the legacy of previous generations of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Impressionist[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Post-Impressionist[/url] artists. Even though [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/les-fauves#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Fauvist artists[/url] explored similar themes to those of the Impressionists, they were innovative in their approach to color \u2013 in their paintings, color was not only a mean of capturing the light and atmosphere, it was a mean for expressing emotions.\n\nDerain was captivated by London, painting a variety of subjects: historical sites like the Palace of Westminster, city\u2019s parks and bustling streets. However, like his predecessors, the Romantic painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-turner#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]J.M.W Turner[/url] and the Impressionist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Claude Monet[/url], Derain chose to focus on the river, painting many scenes of the banks of the Thames. Matisse encouraged Derain to visit London\u2019s museums and in particularly to see Turner\u2019s paintings. Shortly before his arrival to London, Turner\u2019s unfinished paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-turner/the-thames-above-waterloo-bridge-1835][i]The Thames above Waterloo Bridge[/i][/url] (ca. 1830-1835) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-turner/norham-castle-sunrise-1845][i]Norham Castle, Sunrise[/i][/url] (ca. 1845) were exhibited for the first time at the [i]Tate Gallery[/i]. In terms of color, it indeed seems that Derain\u2019s London scenes were closer to Turner\u2019s Venetian paintings than Monet\u2019s views of London.\n\n[i]Waterloo Bridge[/i] depicts the view of the Waterloo Bridge from the Victoria Embankment. It features a blurry view of the Houses of Parliament on the right, and the industrial buildings of the Baltic Wharf on the left side of the painting. However, the focus of the painting is the bright blue bridge that serves as the horizontal line of the composition. [i]Waterloo Bridge[/i] embodies the Fauve spirit \u2013 Derain used pure colors from the tube to create a bright and colorful vision of London. The application of pure colors on the white canvas relates to the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-signac#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Paul Signac[/url] and Signac\u2019s approach to color in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-signac/young-women-of-provence-at-the-well-1892][i]Women at the Well[/i][/url] (1892). Derain painted [i]Waterloo Bridge[/i] in a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pointillism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]pointillist technique[/url] that he began employing in the summer of 1905, when he was staying with Matisse in Collioure. The dabs of bright greens, blues and purples give the surface the appearance of a mosaic. In comparison to the Collioure painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andre-derain/mountains-at-collioure-1905][i]Mountains at Collioure[/i][/url] (1905), the shades of yellow and blue in [i]Waterloo Bridge[/i] are cooler, keeping with the London ambience. While shades of blue, green and purple dominate the canvas, Derain creates a burst of the bright yellow and pink sunlight that erupts from the top right corner of the painting. The bright light reflects on the water in the lighter dabs of yellow and green. For Fauvists colors had an expressive function, and Derain described them as \u201c[i]cartridges of dynamite whose purpose is to discharge light[/i]\u201d. Waterloo Bridge is part of the collection of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid."

        "description": "Like with many of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s masterpieces, there are many unknown facts about his painting [i]The Virgin and Child with St. Anne[/i] (ca. 1503-1519). It has been suggested that the painting was commissioned by the King of France, Louis XII to celebrate the birth of his only daughter Claude in 1499. The choice of subject would be adequate for such an occasion: Anne was the name of the King\u2019s wife and St Anne is the patron saint of pregnant women and women trying to get pregnant. For unknown reasons the painting was not delivered to Louis XII, and observers noted that it was still in Leonardo\u2019s workshop in 1517. The painting eventually ended up in the French royal collection: the first known record of [i]The Virgin and Child with St. Anne[/i] is the 1683 inventory of the Palace of Fontainebleau. While it is not definitive, it is most likely that King Francis I acquired the painting from Leonardo\u2019s assistant, Salai.\n\nThe scene depicts three generations, St Anne, her daughter, the Virgin Mary and Jesus as an infant. From several preparatory works, it is evident that Leonardo devoted a lot of thought to the painting\u2019s composition. [i]The Virgin and Child with St. Anne[/i] is closely tied to the large preparatory study, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/study-for-the-burlington-house-cartoon-the-virgin-and-child-with-st-anne-and-st-john-the-1][i]The Burlington House Cartoon[/i][/url] (ca. 1499-1500): unlike the study that depicts the young figure of Saint John the Baptist, the painting shows young Jesus playing with a lamb. The inclusion of the lamb, a symbol associated with the Passion, hints to Christ\u2019s destiny. Leonardo gave particular significance to the figure of St Anne by making her the axis of the triangular composition. The religious scene is set in a fantastical mountainous landscape. Leonardo used atmospheric perspective to create the illusion of the distant mountains. He also employed the [i]sfumato[/i] technique, that softened the transition between colors, and gave the overall composition a delicate haziness.\n\n[i]The Virgin and Child with St. Anne[/i] holds an important place in art history, influencing Leonardo\u2019s contemporaries as well as subsequent generations of artists. Paintings such as Raphael\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-virgin-and-child-with-saint-john-the-baptist-1507][i]Madonna and Child with Saint John the Baptist[/i][/url] (1507) and Andrea del Sarto\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-sarto/charity][i]Charity[/i][/url] (1518) are examples of Leonardo\u2019s profound influence on Renaissance artists. In the mid-19th century, the painting was hung in the Salon Carr\u00e9 at the Louvre, and was copied by many leading artists of the period like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix]Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]\u00c9douard Manet[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-baptiste-carpeaux]Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux[/url]. The founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud also analyzed the painting in his essay [i]Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood[/i]. Freud\u2019s interpretation inspired [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism#!#resultType:masonry]Surrealist[/url] artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-ernst]Max Ernst[/url]. Ernst\u2019s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-ernst/the-kiss-1927][i]The Kiss[/i][/url] (1927), an homage to [i]The Virgin and Child with St. Anne[/i], emulated the pyramidal grouping, the embracing gesture and triangular composition of Leonardo\u2019s painting."

Its thick volume sways to the left, drawing our attention to the skyline of Haarlem in the distance. To the right of the tree, the sunlit road curves toward the horizon and draws our gaze upward to the cumulus clouds whose billowing and energetic shapes echo the two trees' dense foliage. A feeling of great energy results as, simultaneously, the figurative element of the hunter and his dogs conveys a feeling of ordinary life in harmony with nature as they trek toward the farmhouse glimpsed at the end of the curving road.\n\nWith its strong sense of composition, this work exemplified Ruisdael's classical phase. His innovative technique involved applying paint thickly in order to build up layers of light and shadow to create a sense of depth and profusion of vegetation. At the same time, he employed scientific observation, depicting botanically identifiable trees, leading art historian Kenneth Clark to describe him as \"the greatest master of the natural vision before Constable.\"\n\nProlific, van Ruisdael worked in almost all of the genres of Dutch Golden Age landscape painting. He helped pioneer distinct motifs such as the depiction of water mills. He was influential upon artists of his own time and his work had a noted impact on the Barbizon School and the Hudson River School. Artists Thomas Gainsborough, J.M.W. Turner, and John Constable all studied and copied his landscapes. He also impacted the Impressionists including Monet and the Post-Impressionist Vincent van Gogh."

Set in the reading room of the Baker Library, the mural consists of 24 frescoes, that portray the history of the continent through both the indigenous and the European historical experience. The artist used the symmetrical structure of the reading room\u2019s east and west wing to create historical and cultural parallels between the pre-Hispanic conquest in the east wing, and the post-conquests civilizations represented in the west wing.\n\nOrozco begins the story of Ancient America with the arrival of [i]Quetzalcoatl[/i], a deity that brings a Golden Age to the continent. Accordingly, the mural with[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/departure-of-quetzalcoatl-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934] [i]The departure of Quetzalcoatl[/i][/url] marks the decline of the ancient world, and later its destruction in the fresco [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-8-the-prophecy-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934][i]The Prophecy[/i][/url], that depicts the arrival of Spanish conquistadors. In the west wing, Modern America starts with the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-13-cortez-and-the-cross-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934]advent of the Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s[/url], who began the first phase of the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Cort\u00e9s serves as Quetzalcoatl\u2019s anti-hero counterpart: he also establishes a new society, but the subsequent panels show this world as dark and bleak. The panels [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-15-anglo-america-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934][i]Anglo-America[/i][/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-16-hispano-america-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934][i]Hispano-America[/i][/url] emphasize the different destructive forces of modernity. In [i]Anglo-America[/i], the figures stand in a neat and orderly circle, but they seem devoid of humanity as they stare at a space at the center of the panel. On the other hand, [i]Hispano-America[/i] is a chaotic, bloody scene that shows a revolutionary hero (likely Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata) leading a battle against the rich and the military.\n\nThe layout of the mural invites the comparison between the ancient and the modern world, highlighting themes of human conflict, self-sacrifice, and regeneration. For example, the panel [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-3-ancient-human-sacrifice-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934][i]Ancient Human Sacrifice[/i][/url] that depicts the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/aztec-art]Aztec[/url] ritual of human sacrifice is directly opposite the panel [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-18-modern-human-sacrifice-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934][i]Modern Human Sacrifice[/i][/url], which shows the skeletal figure of an unknown fallen soldier. The artist establishes a clear analogy between these two panels: the religious monument is replaced by the war monument in the background, and the Aztec priest becomes a politician in the modern world. In the mural, the use of pictorial space reflects the artist\u2019s political message. This spatial contrast is most evident in the final group of panels called [url [i]Modern Industrial Man[/i]. These panels indicate that the future of civilization will largely be determined by the relationship between man and industry. The left panel suggests a negative conclusion in which the industry could potentially crush or imprison the modern man. This sentiment is enhanced through the tight composition: the workers are huddled together as they pull two large steel beams that burst into the foreground. The right panel represents a better, more harmonious outcome, in which the men work together to erect a skyscraper. Here, the composition is more balanced, and the man seems to be in command of the industry. In 2013, [i]The Epic of American Civilization[/i] was designated as a National Historic Landmark."

        "description": "In his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Period_final-period,resultType:masonry]final period[/url] in the early 1890s, Paul C\u00e9zanne created a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Series_card-players,resultType:masonry]series[/url] of five oil paintings that depicted the subject of card players. [i]The Card Players[/i] (1890-1892) at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, is the largest and the most elaborate painting of the series. The Barnes version is a five-figure composition and the only one that includes the figure of the young boy who observes the card game. A more condensed version of this painting is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/the-card-players-1893][i]The Card Players[/i][/url] (1890-1892) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, that has only four figures and a less detailed background. The other three paintings in the series are two-figure compositions, depicting two card players sitting opposite each other.\n\nIt was generally assumed that C\u00e9zanne first worked on the multi-figure paintings and then moved on to the simpler compositions featuring only two card players. However, recent technical examinations of the canvases indicate that the opposite was true. Scans revealed that the Metropolitan version was extensively reworked, much more than the larger canvas (135.3 x 181.9) in the Barnes Foundation. Therefore, it seems more likely that C\u00e9zanne expanded the composition, adding more figures and elements as he painted the series. C\u00e9zanne carefully crafted each painting, basing them on multiple preparatory sketches and figure studies he made of local farmers. For example, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/man-with-a-pipe-study-for-the-card-players-1890][i]Man with a Pipe (Study for The Card Players)[/i][/url] (1890-1892) was a study of the figure leaning against the wall in the paintings from the Barnes Foundation and the Metropolitan Museum.\n\nThe series was the artist\u2019s chief contribution to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting]genre painting[/url] \u2013 a genre that focused on everyday life, depicting people engaged in mundane activities. C\u00e9zanne adopted the motif of card players from 17th century Dutch and French genre paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/card-players][i]Card Players in an Interior[/i][/url] (c. 1660) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen]Jan Steen[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/le-nain-brothers/card-players][i]The Card Players (Les joueurs de cartes)[/i][/url] (c. 1635-1640) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/le-nain-brothers]Le Nain brothers[/url]. In comparison to his predecessors, C\u00e9zanne\u2019s paintings lack drama and narrative. Instead, his paintings have a simple setting with subdued figures smoking their pipes and playing cards. C\u00e9zanne\u2019s card players show little expression, appearing passive and reserved or immersed in their respective tasks. The artist also limited the facial expressions of the players: their facial features were usually painted in a few strokes that marked their shadowed or downcast eyes.\n\nArt historians also suggest that C\u00e9zanne\u2019s composition was influenced by the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] masters. Possible prototypes include [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/supper-at-emmaus][i]Supper at Emmaus[/i][/url] (c. 1530) and a lost painting by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini]Giovanni Bellini[/url] of the same subject (c. 1490), that is known through copies and engravings. Similarly, C\u00e9zanne used the arrangement of the elements below the tabletop to create a counterpoint to the figures in the composition. This could also reflect the artist\u2019s desire to enhance the everyday scene of card players with the monumentality of a religious subject. Others suggest that C\u00e9zanne treated [i]The Card Players[/i] like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_still-life,resultType:masonry]his still life paintings[/url], animating the surface with sequences of color contrasts, that alternate between light and dark, warm and cool hues. In the Barnes version, this is evident in details like the patterned tabletop that is formed through the color contrast between light blue and deep shades of red and violet."

People crowd around them and there is little sense of depth or space. The elongated figures of the Kings are characteristic of a painting style that was fashionable around this time.\n\nA figure on the extreme right wears spectacles. His presence may indicate that those around Christ are blind to his significance; Bruegel has used spectacles on other occasions to signify in an ironic manner the inability of the subject to see the truth. Most of the figures, in fact, appear to be gently mocked by the artist.\n\nIt is uncommon for soldiers to be included in a depiction of the Adoration.

He captures perfectly the awkward pose of a young man uncomfortable in formal clothes being sniffed at by the dog of the unfriendly older gentleman. Although dressed informally in dressing gown, slippers and turban the older man's expression, both calculating and suspicious, does nothing to ease the tension of the moment. The conspicuous presence of a Japanese jar may suggest he is a connoisseur."

It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for Alfonso I d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, for his camerino d'alabastro ('chamber of alabaster') in the Castello Estense, Ferrara. It is one of the few mythological pictures by Bellini, who completed it in 1514. After his death soon afterwards (1516), Titian probably modified the landscape on the left to match it to his The Bacchanal of the Andrians (1518\u20131523), also in Alfonso's camerino. A more thorough reworking in about 1529 added more landscape, adding the mountain behind the figures.\r\n\r\nThe scene depicted conflates two episodes in Ovid's Fasti. Priapus, on the right, is attempting to seduce the sleeping nymph Lotis, but is prevented from success by the bray of Silenus' donkey. Around are the drunken Gods: Jupiter has an eagle next to him, Poseidon is caressing Cybele and Ceres, while Hermes is languidly lying on a barrel. The boy with vine-leaves on his head is an unusually young depiction of Bacchus. It is thought that Bellini initially painted the figures as mortals, following a misleading translation of Ovid (the so-called Ovidio volgarizzato), and had to re-paint them with the attributes of the Olympian gods."

        "description": "[i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i] (1877) was created during a pivotal time in the artist\u2019s career. Caillebotte was an active member of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionist[/url] movement, even though he painted in a more realistic style than other members of the group. The quick and loose brushwork of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet]Claude Monet[/url] or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir]Pierre-Auguste Renoir[/url] emphasized motion and the fleeting effects of light on the surface. In contrast, Caillebotte\u2019s precise brushwork and crisp detail gave the impression of a frozen moment or a photographic snapshot. \n\n[i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i] is a typical Impressionist subject, modern life in an urban setting, identified as the intersection between rue de Turin and rue de Moscou. The painting presents the urban transformation of Paris, that went through sweeping renovations of the city commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III and directed by his prefect of Seine, Baron Georges Haussmann. Caillebotte witnessed these vast transformations that were complete in 1870. [i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i] shows the merging of the old and the new city: the couple and the male in the foreground walk on a narrow sidewalk that represents the old city, while a newly constructed building in the backdrop marks the emergence of the new city. The painting is populated by multiple characters placed in a zigzag pattern, which represent the range of social classes that form the urban landscape. Caillebotte most prominently featured the bourgeois class, represented by the elegant couple in the foreground. Different classes are represented to a lesser extent and can be identified by their attire and activity. For instance, a man in the background carrying a ladder is likely a worker. Similarly, the two figures passing each other in front of the second building on the left are wearing unfashionable tattered clothing that indicates their lower status.\n\nCaillebotte exhibited the painting at the third Impressionist exhibition in 1877 together with another large street scene [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/le-pont-de-l-europe-1877][i]Le Pont de l\u2019Europe[/i][/url] (1876). [i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i] was bought by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1964, where experts have extensively studied the painting and its many [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/rue-de-paris-jour-de-pluie-etude-1877]preparatory sketches and studies[/url] to better understand Caillebotte\u2019s artistic process. Research and experiments conducted by the Institute have presented compelling evidence that Caillebotte used the optical device [i]camera lucida[/i] for the preparatory sketches of the painting. The device would allow the artist to see the scene and the drawing surface at the same time, making it easier to determine an accurate perspective. Still, there is no documentation supporting the claim that Caillebotte ever used such a tool. Caillebotte, possibly, never discussed his methods because many proponents of Impressionism, including writer \u00c9mile Zola, criticized paintings that emulated the crispness and precision of a photograph as \u2018anti-artistic\u2019.\n\nAfter the initial sketches which helped establish the essential spatial and architectural elements of the intersection, Caillebotte made character studies and even created a painted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/rue-de-paris-jour-de-pluie-etude-1877-0][i]Sketch for Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i][/url] (1877). In the sketch, he further developed the color palette and the placement of various figures. Caillebotte continued to make changes on the original canvas, like adding new characters, the two women walking away in the background. The ambitious painting represents the height of Caillebotte\u2019s artistic achievement, as the artist would never again attempt a multi-figure composition on this scale."

        "description": "Music was an important theme in the art of Jan Vermeer, embodied in one of his well-known paintings, [i]The music lesson[/i]. This type of scene was also painted by Vermeer\u2019s contemporary, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-van-mieris-the-elder]Frans van Mieris the Elder[/url], a genre and portrait painter. In [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-van-mieris-the-elder/the-duet-1658][i]The Duet[/i][/url] (1658), Mieris portrayed a damsel and gentleman making music together, while a servant brings over a drink and music book. In comparison to Mieris, Vermeer reduced the activity in the scene, but in doing so he added ambiguity to the nature of the event unfolding in the painting. Even though the title suggests that the lady playing the virginal is accompanied by her tutor, the iconography implies that the man in question could be a lover or a suitor.\n\nMusic is a metaphor for harmony and love, and the type of melodies played on the virginal celebrated love and the comfort it brings. The virginal was most likely produced by the famous Antwerp instrument maker Andreas Ruckers or inspired by his craftsmanship style. In Vermeer\u2019s time, such a virginal would have been in a wealthy household, where young ladies could practice playing the refined instrument. On the lid of the virginal Vermeer placed a Latin inscription [i]MUSICA LETIATIAE CO[ME]S/ MEDICINA DOLOR[IS],[/i] meaning \u2018Music is a companion in pleasure and a balm in sorrow\u2019. The inscription speaks of feelings of pleasure and solace, hinting that there is a romantic connection between the two figures. \n\nAbove the virginal is a mirror, which Vermeer cleverly used to reveal the young woman\u2019s face. The reflection in the mirror corresponds with the young man\u2019s gaze, who is attentively observing the woman playing. Vermeer also revealed his own presence by including part of his easel in the mirror reflection. By including the easel the artist reveals his position and gaze on the scene. It can be interpreted that as the man is enthralled with the woman playing, the artist is similarly absorbed in the process of painting.\n\nOn the back wall there is a painting portraying Roman Charity, the story of Cimon and his daughter Pero, who managed through love and devotion to save her father from a death sentence. Pero is considered an ideal of spiritual love and Christian charity. Right under the painting, there is a white jug, which can symbolize sensual nourishment. In this way, the iconography reinforces the overall theme of spiritual and sensual love. In the foreground the artist painted another instrument, a bass viol. Through infrared technology it is known that this was a later addition to the painting since Vermeer painted it over the floor tiles and the woman\u2019s red dress. The two instruments are another element that suggests shared pleasures and potential harmony, and as such reflect the possible relationship between the young man and woman.\n\nAccording to available records, the painting was initially attributed to Frans van Mieris the Elder. The misidentification was a result of a wrong reading of the signature. The painting was officially attributed to Jan Vermeer in an 1876 exhibition at the Royal Academy in London."

Eight of these, including this painting, were owned by Benjamin Sharpe of Hanwell Park, Middlesex. Another painting from this set, which also came from the Sharpe collection, was sold in these rooms, 8 December 2011, lot 291, for \u00a3320,000.\n\nFirst published in 1780, Oberon is the most celebrated work of the great German poet Christoph Martin Weiland (1733\u20131813) \u2013 earning the author the title of \u2018The German Ariosto\u2019. An epic saga that tells of the adventures of the knight H\u00fcon of Bordeaux, Duke of Guyenne, condemned by the Emperor Charlemagne to travel to Babylon for slaying his son, the despicable Prince Charlot; his relationship with Oberon, King of the Fairies; and his love for Amanda (Rezia), daughter of the Khalif of Baghdad, the poem is both rich with earlier literary allusion and was a significant influence on later writers. Based upon the French\u00a0medieval romance Huon de Bordeaux, it also draws inspiration from a range of diverse sources including Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, Alexander Pope\u2019s version of Chaucer\u2019s The Merchant's Tale, and the Arabian mythology of A Thousand and One Nights; and was in turn the basis for Carl Maria von Weber\u2019s classic opera of the same name, first performed at Covent Garden in 1826. Written in English with the role of Sir Huon performed by the great eighteenth-century tenor John Braham, Weber\u2019s opera was later translated into German by Theodor Hell; with performances mounted in Leipzig in 1826; Dublin, Edinburgh and Vienna in 1827; Prague in 1828; and Budapest in 1829.\n\nWeiland\u2019s poem was also a major influence upon many other great literary and musical works of the European canon; including Schiller\u2019s Don Carlos; Goethe\u2019s Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy; and Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute, as well as the work of the Portuguese poet  Francisco Manoel de Nascimento (1734\u20131819). An adaptation of the poem by Sophie Seyler (1737\u20131789), entitled H\u00fcon und Armande, was re-adapted by Karl Ludwig Giesecke (1761\u20131833) to provide a libretto for the great conductor Paul Wranitzky (1756\u20131808), and it was translated into English by Matthew \u2018Monk\u2019 Lewis (1775\u20131818), William Sotheby (1757\u20131833), and in America by John Quincy Adams (1767\u20131848).\u00a0\n\nThis dramatic picture is one of a set of ten illustrations which Fuseli painted for the second edition of William Sotheby's English translation of the poem, published in 1805. Eight of these were owned by Benjamin Sharpe, a Captain in the Royal Navy and scion of the banking firm Goslings and Sharpe, who bought Hanwell Park in Middlesex in 1848. The episode depicted in the present painting is from part I, verses 18\u201319 in which H\u00fcon, seeking shelter from a storm, meets a wild man dressed in tatters and cat-skins in a cave. This proves to be Scherasmin, servant to H\u00fcon\u2019s late father, S\u00e9guin of Bordeaux, who had died in the Holy Land.\u00a0Roused by the opportunity to serve his old master\u2019s son, Scherasmin pledges his undying loyalty to H\u00fcon on his journey. Fuseli received 120 guineas from the publishers Cadell and Davies and felt he had made \u2018a bargain not very advantageous to myself\u2019, in contrast to the 18 guineas the engravers were paid per plate.\n\nWeiland had lived in Switzerland for a number of years when a young man, and among his friends was Fuseli's father, Johann Caspar F\u00fcssli, a prominent portrait painter in Zurich.\u00a0Only twelve years his junior the young artist must have known the great poet and Fuseli himself had begun his career as a writer, having studied theology and the classics as a young man.\n\nSource : https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2017/old-masters-evening-sale-l17033/lot.62.html"

The painting expressed the artist\u2019s anxieties about their relationship, both regarding the circumstances of their romance and his fear of being taken advantage of or swallowed up by Gala. Gala\u2019s presence is ambiguous, she is both loved and feared. She represents the artist\u2019s fear of castration and female sexuality, but also the potential to achieve spiritual and sexual liberation through this relationship.\n\nThe most threatening element of the painting is the grasshopper, which relates to Dal\u00ed\u2019s childhood fear of insects. Dal\u00ed often wrote poems that accompanied his paintings, and in the poem for [i]The Great Masturbator[/i], he referred to the insect as a locust.  For Dal\u00ed, the fear of the grasshopper or the locust related to the idea of being swallowed up or consumed, which is likely why the grasshopper clings to the lower part of the face, in place of the mouth. According to one interpretation, the grasshopper serves as another representation of Gala. This claim is supported by another painting from the period, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/portrait-of-paul-eluard][i]Portrait of Paul \u00c9luard[/i][/url] (1929).  He began the portrait while Gala was still with \u00c9luard, but by the time he finished, she had left \u00c9luard. The portrait shares several elements with [i]The Great Masturbator[/i]: the roaring lion, the profile portrait of Dal\u00ed, and most importantly the grasshopper. The grasshopper likely implies Gala\u2019s presence, and in a similar way, it signifies Dal\u00ed\u2019s anxieties regarding adultery and the implications of their relationship.\n \n[i]The Great Masturbator[/i] remained in the artist\u2019s personal collection. After his death, the painting was willed to the national collection of Spain, and today it is part of the Museo Reina Sof\u00eda collection in Madrid."

        "description": "From the early 1960s and onwards, Roy Lichtenstein began to explore art as a theme by reinterpreting masterpieces of artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]Paul C\u00e9zanne[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piet-mondrian]Piet Mondrian[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url]. Between 1962 and 1963, Lichtenstein created four paintings based on Picasso\u2019s portraits of women, the last of which is [i]Woman with Flowered Hat[/i] (1963).  The painting is based on [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/dora-maar-with-cat-1941][i]Dora Maar with Cat[/i][/url] (1941), a portrait of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dora-maar]Dora Maar[/url], the Surrealist artist who was Picasso\u2019s lover and muse from 1936 to the mid-1940s.\n\nThe tumultuous and at times abusive relationship between Picasso and Maar was reflected in Picasso\u2019s depictions of Maar. In [i]Dora Maar with Cat[/i] and other paintings, Picasso depicted his muse as a tormented figure, distorting her features with jagged forms. [i]Dora Maar with Cat[/i] also expressed Picasso\u2019s anxiety and reaction to the troubling events of the time, the Spanish Civil War, and World War II. This angst can be sensed in the spontaneous and emotional nature of the work expressed through bold colors, jagged forms, and dense layers of paint. Lichtenstein possibly was drawn to the portrait because he tended to depict female figures in distress in comic book paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/drowning-girl-1963][i]Drowning Girl[/i][/url] (1963) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/crying-girl-1964][i]Crying Girl[/i][/url] (1964).\n\nIn [i]Woman with Flowered Hat[/i], Lichtenstein preserved all the main elements of Picasso\u2019s painting but made significant stylistic changes in terms of color, texture, and form. He painted the portrait in his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pop-art]Pop Art[/url] style that was influenced by mass-produced commercial imagery of comic books, cartoons, and advertising. This style was characterized by primary colors, flat uniform planes, black outlines, and hand-painted Ben-Day dots used in the printing process of inexpensive publications. By imitating mass-produced imagery Lichtenstein removes the painterly sensibility expressed by Picasso. His approach is calculated and meticulous, he paints in an impersonal and precise manner.\n\nLichtenstein conflates Picasso\u2019s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cubism]Cubism[/url], a groundbreaking style in Modern art history with the style of cheap commercial publications and advertisements. The artist\u2019s combination of high art and popular imagery was understood as an attack on predecessors like Picasso. However, [i]Woman with Flowered Hat[/i] is more of an homage than a parody. Lichtenstein deals with the complex legacy of Picasso by reinterpreting it for the contemporary world saying: \u201cPicasso has become a kind of popular object\u2026 one has the feeling there should be a reproduction of Picasso in every home\u201d. By adapting Picasso\u2019s painting to a contemporary society driven by consumerism and mass production, Lichtenstein gives the image new relevance. He explained: \u201cWhat I wanted to express is not that Picasso was known and therefore commonplace. Nobody thought of Picasso as common. What I am painting is a kind of Picasso done the way a cartoonist does it or the way it might be described to you, so it loses the subtleties of Picasso, but it takes on other characteristics\u201d."

No one else appeares in Monet's paintings as often as Camille. In those year, portraits of women were mostly ordered by bourgeois clients, but among progressive painters, the artistic structure became more important than the identity of the portrayed person. The masterly style, the lack of details, and the plainness of the colours led to a completely new directness of expression, independent of the facial gestures of the depicted person. In this picture, the shimmering reds, blues, greens, and white that capture the brilliance of a sun-drenched day are applied with many small brushstrokes, whose varied shapes create the different textures of flowers, grass, and clothing. Meanwhile, the features of the woman are completely indistinct."

        "description": "This colorful figure painting is one of a series of Roman mythological works commissioned by Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, for his palace at Ferrara. It was part of a group of three painted by Titian between 1518 and 1525. The other two are [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/the-worship-of-venus-1518][i]Worship of Venus[/i][/url] (1518-1519) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/bacchus-and-ariadne-1523][i]Bacchus and Ariadne[/i][/url] (1520-1523). It stemmed from the Roman writer Philostratus, who left a collection of descriptions of pictures under the title \"Imagines.\" One concerned the visit of Bacchus and his entourage of satyrs and bacchantes to the island of Andros. There, the natives were blessed by the presence of a river of wine. Upon the suggestion of his patron, Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, who wanted works to decorate his private [i]studiolo[/i], Titian reconstructed the classical narrative in this masterpiece.\n\nThe scene is set on the island of Andros, where the followers of Bacchus await his arrival in varying stages of inebriation, as they drink from the island's river of wine. Bacchus himself is not present, but his ship can be seen in the distance. Meantime, gods, men, and children celebrate the sublime effects of wine, whose consumption, according to Philostratus, makes men dominant, rich, generous to their friends, handsome and tall beyond their dreams. If Philostratus' description was sparse, this painting is riotously full of detail and incident, and only Titian could create, at the center of the scene, the brilliant and unforgettable emblem of this Bacchic setting. Silhouetted against the sky, a dancing youth holds a glass wine jug. He looks up, like an astronomer, at this sun and moon of his inebriated universe. A debate about balance and the horizontal is conducted by the clear vessel, tilted, and the equator of wine that it contains. Beneath such a heavenly body, the earth will be drunk and inspiring too.\n\nWith the coming of dawn on Andros, the river god, instead of adopting his canonical reclining position, remains a lie-a-bed in his mulch of vines (top-right). The wine-red stream has also left the nymph in the foreground - based on a classical statue of Ariadne - to her erotic slumbers, as undisturbed by the singing, dancing, and drinking that continue among the elaborately interwoven throng as by Apollo's call. Titian also deviated from the original text by creating two immigrants to Andros. They are the two courtly young women reclining in the center foreground amid a litter of overturned vessels of various sorts, indicating abandon. The girl in red has had her attentions to the nude youth (deriving from a figure in Michelangelo's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/sketch-of-a-nude-man-study-for-the-battle-of-cascina][i]Battle of Cascina[/i][/url]) interrupted by her companion. In contrast, he has been distracted by the dancer in ochre. Now, in close conversation, the girls do not engage directly with those about them as, with lingering gestures, they lay aside the shepherds' pipes, which, in more than one sense, they have been playing. Their tune, on the paper, is now taken up by the singers standing among the trees behind them. These music-makers are to be distinguished from the Andrians - fellow mortals - and from the spirits and deities that occupy the place. It may be understood that the immortals, and indeed the Andrians themselves, have been conjured up in the imagination by the girls, or else that - sensitive to the spirit of the scene and the effects of wine - they are rewarded by the attentions of beings who await the call of mortals' music and imagination.\n\nOther figures also allude to classical statuary. The maenad (female follower of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine) dressed in white, is a reference to the sculpture of an antique torso in the Grimani collection, while the male nude pouring wine on the left appears to be a reworking of The Wounded Gaul, a work of Hellenistic art unearthed in Rome around 1515 and probably known to Titian through a drawing.\n\nTitian called this type of picture a [i]poesie[/i]. It is the creation of the artist, and it addresses its audience as does a poem, allusively - inviting a meditation, a reverie, an engagement of sensibility, and never arriving at a definitive meaning."

Braque thus felt comfortable enough to stay and paint during his time there, all the while still feeling as if he were somewhere new. Heavily influenced by Paul Cezanne, Braque most likely painted Landscape near Antwerp in the technique that Cezanne used most, painting and drawing at the same time.

Sheeler expressed his feelings about the emotional symbolism of technology when he wrote: \"Every age manifests itself by some external evidence. In a period such as ours when only a comparatively few individuals seem to be given to religion, some form other than the Gothic cathedral must be found.

The painting depicted the scene with an unflattering air, and it did not romanticize the depictions of grief and mourning, as in traditional Romantic paintings. Critics of the piece decried both the style of the painting as well as the size. At 10 feet tall by 22 feet wide, the size of the canvas was typically reserved for religious or heroic scenes, and the painting critics said was intentionally ugly and harsh. For the subjects in the painting, Courbet also used the real people who had actually been at the burial, rather than actors used as models for the art. As it had such a deleterious effect on the Romantic style of painting, it could also be easily called \u201cThe Burial of Romanticism,\u201d as Courbet himself said: \u201cThe Burial at Ornans was in reality the burial of Romanticism.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis 22 foot long canvas situated in a main room at the Musee d'Orsay buries the viewer as if he or she were in a cave. In a decidedly non-classical composition, figures mill about in the darkness, unfocused on ceremony. As a prime example of Realism, the painting sticks to the facts of a real burial and avoids amplified spiritual connotations. Emphasizing the temporal nature of life, Courbet intentionally did not let the light in the painting express the eternal. While sunset could have expressed the great transition of the soul from the temporal to the eternal, Courbet covered the evening sky with clouds so the passage of day into night is just a simple echo of the coffin passing from light into the dark of the ground. Some critics saw the adherence to the strict facts of death as slighting religion and criticized it as a shabbily composed structure with worn-faced working folk raised up to life-size in a gigantic work as if they had some kind of noble importance. Other critics such as Proudhon loved the inference of equality and virtue of all people and recognized how such a painting could help turn the course of Western art and politics."

        "description": "For Gabriele M\u00fcnter, as for Wassily Kandinsky, the discovery of the area around the small Upper Bavarian town of Murnau in the foothills of the Alps meant a decisive turning point in her artistic development. In the fall of 1908, after years of constant travel and lengthy stays abroad, both had moved into a shared apartment on Ainmillerstrasse in Munich. Shortly before, they had visited Murnau for the first time and soon afterwards returned there for a joint study visit with Alexej Jawlensky and Marianne von Werefkin.\n\nA diary entry by M\u00fcnter from 1911 clearly reflects the feeling of liberation from years of artistic searching and the enthusiasm for a new beginning: \"We had seen Murnau on an excursion and recommended it to Jawlensky and Werefkin - who also called us there in the autumn. We lived in the Griesbr\u00e4u and we liked it very much. After a short period of torment I made a big leap - from copying nature - more or less impressionistic - to feeling a content, to abstracting - to giving an extract.\"\n\nThe small oil study by Jawlensky and Werefkin, which shows the painter couple lying down in a meadow, was created during a joint stay in Murnau in July 1909. It impressively demonstrates the change in M\u00fcnter's work, the suddenly bold, uncompromising independence and the emphasis on reduced outline drawing compared to her previous painting studies based on nature, which were based on the tradition of late Impressionism. Radical simplification of form and clear, strong color contrasts characterize the picture. The figures are inserted into the dense, homogeneous green of the meadow slope and the equally dense blue of the sky and the mountains as simple basic forms, the faces barely indicated.\n\nAll the important elements are succinctly and accurately set in bold black contours using the Cloisonnism technique, which Alexej Jawlensky, who ultimately came from Paul Gauguin, had taught her. During this time, M\u00fcnter maintained particularly close artistic contacts with Jawlensky in particular and, above all, incorporated his suggestions for a \"synthesis\" of the picture - a \"consolidation\" of the elements into a few characteristic forms - in her direct view of things, freed from everything irrelevant. In the first years in Murnau, M\u00fcnter created a large number of important pictures with a new enthusiasm for work, which are an essential artistic contribution to the later movement of the 'Blauer Reiter'.\n\n[url href=https://www.lenbachhaus.de/en/discover/collection-online/detail/jawlensky-und-werefkin-30018337]lenbachhaus[/url]"

        "description": "This painting debuted at Kahlo's exhibition in Julien Levy's New York gallery in 1938, and was one of the works that most fascinated Andr\u00e9 Breton, the founder of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url]. The canvas in the New York show is a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url] of the artist and her spider monkey, Fulang-Chang, a symbol employed as a surrogate for the children that she and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Rivera[/url] could not have. The arrangement of figures in the portrait signals the artist's interest in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] paintings of the Madonna and Child. After the New York exhibition, a second frame containing a mirror was added. The later inclusion of the mirror is a gesture inviting the viewer into the work: it was through looking at herself intensely in a mirror in her months spent at home after her bus accident that Kahlo first began painting portraits and delving deeper into her [i]psyche[/i]. The inclusion of the mirror, considered from this perspective, is a remarkably intimate vision into both the artist's aesthetic process and into her personal introspection.\n\nIn many of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]Kahlo's self-portraits[/url], she is accompanied by monkeys, dogs, and parrots, all of which she kept as pets. Since the Middle Ages, small spider monkeys, like those kept by Kahlo, have been said to symbolize the devil, heresy, and paganism, finally coming to represent the fall of man, vice, and the embodiment of lust. These monkeys were depicted in the past as a cautionary symbol against the dangers of excessive love and the base instincts of man. Kahlo again depicts herself with her monkey in both [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-a-monkey-1938]1938[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-monkey-1940]1940[/url]. In a later version in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-small-monkey-1945]1945[/url], Kahlo paints her monkey and also her dog, [i]Xolotl[/i]. This little dog that often accompanies the artist, is named after a mythological Aztec god, known to represent lightning and death, and also to be the twin of [i]Quetzalcoatl[/i], both of who had visited the underworld. All of these pictures, including [i]Fulang-Chang and I[/i] include 'umbilical' ribbons that wrap between Kahlo's and the animal's necks. Kahlo is the Madonna and her pets become the holy (yet darkly symbolic) infant for which she longs."

        "description": "[i]Double Nude Portrait: The Artist and his Second Wife[/i] (1937) shows the painter with his second wife and model, Patricia Preece. Sometimes the painting is called [i]Leg of Mutton Nude[/i] because Preece lies on her back next to a raw leg of lamb. The couple is seen naked, their bodies are depicted in a realist manner. Spencer concentrated on the colors and textures of human skin which are contrasted with the flesh tones of the leg of mutton.\n\nThe two figures are seen up close in a condense space, but despite their physical proximity, there is a sense of detachment and discomfort between the pair. Spencer painted the portrait at his house in Cookham, where he lived from 1932 to 1938. In 1934, Spencer became involved with Preece, and he painted [i]Double Nude Portrait: The Artist and his Second Wife[/i] the same year he married her. However, by then their relationship was already troubled and strained: Patricia returned to her long-term partner, the artist Dorothy Hepworth, and the marriage with Spencer was never consummated. The sexually charged portrait may reflect some of Spencer\u2019s frustrations with the marriage to Preece.\nAccording to Spencer\u2019s papers, the painting is one of seven nudes or semi-nudes that the artist painted from life or life drawings. For Spencer, these were significant works, in part because they greatly differed from his figure paintings of imaginative and visionary scenes like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stanley-spencer/the-last-supper-1920][i]The Last Supper[/i][/url] (1920) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stanley-spencer/the-resurrection-cookham-1927][i]The Resurrection, Cookham[/i][/url] (1924-1927). In his writings, he explained: \u201c\u2018I wish my shows could include the nudes (oil) that I have done. I think having them interspersed in a show would convey the range of my work. They are quite different. I wish there were more of them, but I have never had pro models, not liking the idea. I believe I could do some good painting if I did.\u201d Despite this, it appears that these seven nude paintings are the only nudes the artist painted from life.\nStill, for Spencer, these paintings demonstrated his artistic range and emphasized a new aspect of his work. [i]The Double Nude Portrait: The Artist and his Second Wife[/i] is the largest and most complex out of the series of nude paintings painted from life. In his writings, he referred to the painting: \u201cWhen I put it alongside any of my other work it shows how needed it is to give to my work the variety that is so refreshing. The big double nude is rather a remarkable thing. There is in it male, female, and animal flesh. The remarkable thing is that to me it is absorbing and restful to look at. There is none of my usual imagination in this thing: it is direct from nature and my imagination never works faced by objects or landscapes. But something is satisfying in looking at it. It was done with zest and my direct painting capacity I had.\u201d\n\nDuring World War I, Spencer began to conceptualize a unique space for the exhibition of his paintings. Spencer called this building \u2018Church-house\u2019, a half secular, half religious space that represented peace and love. Spencer wrote about the nude paintings in his plan for the \u2018Church-house\u2019: \u201cThere would be a room of nudes from life\u2026 The room of nudes would show how much they balance a need in the whole cosmical conception\u2026 I wanted the in the nude section to show the analogy between the Church and the prescribed nature of worship, and human love\u201d. The painting was acquired by the Tate Gallery, London in 1974."

The profusion of scenes and moralizing sense applied by the artists are part of Hieronymous Bosch\u00b4s influence on this work. Bruegel combines two distinct visual traditions within the panel. These are his native tradition of Northern woodcuts of the Dance of Death and the Italian conception of the Triumph of Death, as in frescoes he would have seen in the Palazzo Sclafani in Palermo and in the Camposanto Monumentale at Pisa."

The dramatic setting features an empty central plinth where the fate of the two defendants rests. Pylades and Orestes stand naked on the right, while Iphigenia dressed in white observes them on the left, preparing to deliver the death sentence. The accused are charged with stealing a gold statue, barely visible in the top left of the frame. They are to be executed on the stone altar.\n\nAccording to West, his work was inspired by Correggio, with its high drama, rich color, and play of dark and light. However, he also drew inspiration from the history paintings of his contemporaries and friends, Gavin Hamilton and Anton Raphael Mengs, whom he studied with in Italy. Influenced by low relief sculpture of the Classical age, West used bright colors and clear imagery to highlight the foreground. He was also inspired by the frescoes of his artistic hero, Raphael.\n\nProduced during the Enlightenment era, this Neoclassical work reflects the era's promotion of civil society's value. The moral argument for educating the people was strong, and West, though not an intellectual, shared this belief. He saw history painting as a means to \"instruct the rising generation in honorable and virtues deeds.\" In the 18th century, knowledge of the history and culture of classical Rome was mainly the preserve of the intellectual elite, but large works like West's aimed to reach a broader audience."

I wish to sell a Group of Seven painting that\u2019s very dear to me to invest in a community.\n\nThe painting is \u2018Trapper\u2019s Cabin (North Bay area)\u2019 painted by historically significant Canadian Group of Seven artist Franz Johnston. He created it when travelling to Northern Ontario during the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s. My Uncle William B. Bate bought the painting and displayed it prominently in his home overlooking the Rosedale Golf course in Toronto. William Bradnee Bate founded Bate Chemical and manufactured resins, house paint, glue and wood preservative in the lower Don Valley just off the Don Valley Parkway. Commuters used to see the large brick chimney with his name on it. Part of his old factory now forms the Metro Toronto Police Services Dog Academy; the rest is now parkland.\n\nWhy do I want to sell this painting? I don\u2019t. As I said, it\u2019s very dear to me as it reminds me of my Aunt Jean and Uncle William, two very kind people who where very important to me. The painting is also peice of Canada, and it reminds me of home.\nBut something has come up that\u2019s much more important, and is the reason for this appeal.\n\nThe United Church is selling the church and community center that formed the focal point of my home town. I wish to buy it, form a non profit association, and continue to provide the church and the hall to the surrounding community.\n\nThe Carnarvon Zion United church, built 130 years ago by pioneering hands with local materials, formed the nucleus of the area. Many weddings, funerals and wakes, prayers, celebrations, happened there and hopes and dreams began inside its walls. I\u2019m not being overly dramatic here, this place helped form the belief system and morals for some major figures, ones that become Canadian and world leaders, financial executives, inventors, developers and one who became Executive Secretary of United Nations.\n\nIt's been the jubilant epicenter of many a function: Town halls, community meetings, food drives and fund raisers. The Strawberry Socials, the pancake breakfasts and the Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. The Cub Scout, Scout, Brownie, and Guide weekly meetings as early as 1947. The place for planning and for protest. This place has seen it all and the place is filled with over a century of laughter sorrow and joy.\n\nIt solidified the community.\n\nIt has also been solace of many good and humble men and woman - this place is a significant part of their lives and they lovingly maintained it cared for it - it\u2019s been much more than just a church.\n\nI would hate to see it taken away from the town of Canarvon, to become some trendy character home for someone detached from its rich history \u2013 taken away from those who love it.\n\nThis is where I need a caring benefactor.\n\nI would come to you hat in hand but I have something to offer: a valuable painting. I would like to sell the Franz Johnston for $350,000.00. I know I may or may not get this amount at auction. The funds would be enough to allow me to buy the church, make any necessary repairs and renovations and set up the association to promote and provide for community use.\n\nThank you.\n\nAbout me: I grew up in in the Haliburton Highlands, I trained in design and photography before joining the RCMP in 1990 posted to Richmond. In 1999 I attended Capilano University to begin a new career in animation games and app development. I have worked at Electronic Arts, Sony, and Microsoft. I now work in animation, photography. http://icehound.net/\n\nhttps://heritagemapsalgonquin.com/content/galleries/stanhope-gallery/zion-church-100-years-article-minden-area-91pdf.pdf"

Courbet's elevated status as a figure of great intellect and importance is highlighted by his slight backward tilt of the head and his position standing directly in the unfiltered light.\n\nHowever, at the same time, Courbet's sense of self-importance is also evident in the painting. His beard points towards the patron as if in judgment, while the artist's stick is double the size of Bruyas', alluding to the artist's strength and dominance."

As if to say: my art is a reflection of America, and all of America is reflected in my illustrations. \n\nThe portrait on the canvass is a large, serene, likable face. It is drawn in black and white, like the first Rockwell magazine covers were drawn, symbolizing the return to the beginning of his art. The artist puts before our eyes what he has done for his whole life: at the end of his artistic production, he puts himself on the cover of the [i]The Saturday Evening Post[/i]."

Typically, such paintings were of family members or important patrons, and this is evident in the present work, which depicts Frances Seymour-Conway, the daughter of the Marquess of Hertford, who was a great admirer of Reynolds. Along with a companion portrait of her sister Elizabeth, this painting demonstrates the artist's mastery of paint and his ability to capture the fashionable sophistication of British high society.\n\nArt historians No\u00e9mi Duperron and Lucy Davis note that the portraits emphasize the women's stylish hairstyles and clothing, with Reynolds using different consistencies of paint to convey the light and transparency of the frilled collars. He also worked quickly, employing a wet-in-wet technique to capture the sisters' clothing.\n\nYet Reynolds was not simply interested in creating glamorous images. He also sought to convey the humanity of his sitters. In this painting, Frances is depicted with a pose that reflects her recent widowhood, inspired by Italian painting techniques that conveyed melancholy and thoughtfulness. Through this depiction, Reynolds captures not only her grief but also an idealized image of femininity that is both fashionable and deeply emotional."

Here the woman fills the centre of the composition and is shown close up, offering the spectator a view of a sculptural back. The wicker chairs around her suggest that the scene took place in the artist's studio, rue Caulaincourt.\n\nAlthough at the time the theme of a woman at her toilet was often treated, especially by Mary Cassatt and Bonnard, it was above all the naturalist influence of Degas which dominates in this painting by Lautrec. The neglect of the academic pose and the accelerated perspective rather unusual in Lautrec's work sound like an echo to the series of women at their toilet that Degas presented at the eighth and last Impressionist exhibition in 1886. The framing of the scene and the high viewpoint bring to mind the masterly pastels by Degas whom Lautrec deeply admired. Like his elder, Lautrec showed women \"without their frills\" as if he were \"peeping through the keyhole\". However, he differs from Degas in the humanity with which he observed and painted them.\n\nThis painting has led to a number of misunderstandings. Indeed, it has had several titles and its date has been changed. It has now been established that it was painted in 1889 and not in 1896 as is stated in the old catalogues. It is certainly this work which Lautrec exhibited under the name of \"Rousse\" in the Exhibition of the XX in Brussels in 1890. This title, chosen by the artist himself, recalls his preference for the red-haired models he painted all his life."

        "description": "[i]Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary)[/i] (1891) was the first major canvas Paul Gaugin painted in Tahiti. He traveled there in 1891 seeking a wild tropical paradise free from the constraints of modern society. The artist soon discovered that this \u2018primitive paradise\u2019 did not exist, and instead he witnessed the impact of French colonial policies that the suppression of Polynesian native culture, customs, and religious beliefs.\n\nIn [i]Ia Orana Maria[/i] Gauguin subtly addressed this tension by translating the traditional Christian subject to a Polynesian setting. The painting depicts an encounter between two Tahitian women and a visionary Madonna and Child. The women pay homage to the Madonna and Child, greeting them with words written in Roman characters at the bottom left of the painting \u2018Ia Orana Maria\u2019. \u2018Ia Orana\u2019 is a common salutation in Tahiti, meaning that the title of the painting translates to the greeting \u2018Hello Mary\u2019 or \u2018Hail Mary\u2019. Next to the two women is the figure of an angel with golden wings that are separated and partially concealed by a flowering bush. This arrangement is reminiscent of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/the-vision-after-the-sermon-jacob-wrestling-with-the-angel-1888][i]Vision After the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel[/i][/url] (1888), in which the tree trunk in the center of the composition separates the angel from the devout Bretton women. While the Tahitian setting is lusher and more colorful, the two paintings share the principle of combining everyday life with supernatural elements.\n\n[i]Ia Orana Maria[/i] is an example of Gauguin\u2019s ability to fuse different cultural influences: Christian iconography with references to non-Western (Polynesian, Javanese, Japanese) cultures. Gauguin often relied on reproductions and photographs as sources for his paintings, and these visuals were often essential to his artistic practice. One of these photographs was of the Buddhist temple of Borobudur on the island of Java. The photo shows two sculptured friezes, [i]Monks on the Benares Road[/i] at the top and [i]The Arrival of Maitrakanyaka at Nandana[/i] at the bottom. Gauguin appropriated elements from the frieze to the composition of [i]Ia Orana Maria[/i]: he used the two male figures from the left side of the top frieze as the basis for the female worshipers who pay homage to the Tahitian Virgin and Child. He also altered the clothing and covered the women\u2019s bodies with Tahitian pareos and drapery. By combining different sources and adjusting them into a new structure, Gauguin was able to transform the creations of other artists into his own. The figures from the temple of Borobudur continued to be an inspiration for the artist in later works such as the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/tahitian-pastoral][i]Faa Iheihe[/i][/url] (1898) and the woodcut [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/change-of-residence-1899][i]Changement de r\u00e9sidence (Change of Residence)[/i][/url] (1899).\n\nGauguin described [i]Ia Orana Maria[/i] in detail in a letter from March 1892 commenting that he was pleased with the painting. He also reproduced the motif of Madonna and Child from the painting into other mediums, such as the zincograph [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/ia-orana-maria-hail-mary-1895][i]Ia Orana Maria[/i[/url]] (1894) and charcoal drawing [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/hail-mary-ia-orana-maria-1895][i]Ia Orana Maria[/i][/url] (1895), that he dedicated to Neo-Impressionist artist and patron Count Antoine de La Rochefoucauld."

Among these works was a portrait of a gentleman, which was brought to the attention of experts who advised to withdraw it from sale for further investigation. The stylistic similarities to works by the great Spanish master led to extensive research, further technical analysis and an x-radiograph confirm the attribution to Vel\u00e1zquez. Researchers think he painted the portrait between 1632 and 1635, after his first trip to Italy. The sitter is unknown, but experts think it could be Juan Mateos, master of the hunt for Philip IV of Spain. Until the nineteenth century, little was known outside of Spain of Vel\u00e1zquez's work. His paintings mostly escaped being stolen by the French marshals during the Peninsular War. It remains a mystery how Matthew Shepperson, a jobbing artist who made minor ducats copying famous paintings at Buckingham Palace, got his hands on a Vel\u00e1zquez. He made a hobby of collecting portraits, and the painting is in excellent condition so he probably had no idea it was even as old as it is. An invoice of seven shillings was found in his papers that could refer to his purchase of the unknown Vel\u00e1zquez portrait. And so the painting that was bought for several shillings, and was due to go for sale for \u00a3300 is now expected to fetch up to \u00a33 million, 10,000 times exceeding the original estimate. By the last count there were ninety-eight acknowledged pictures solely by Velazquez in existence and only four are in private hands."

Other artists, usually motivated by the higher purposes of patriotism or pacifism, have shown the disasters of war, suppression, and martyrdom; torture and pain are often represented as the just deserts of sinners tumbling into hell, and the roasting and beheading of saints are depicted to serve the greater glory of God. But Beckmann sees no purpose in the suffering he shows; there is no glory for anybody, no compensation, no gloating over justice accomplished-only enseless pain, and cruelty for its own sake. Beckmann blames human nature as such, and there seems to be no physical escape from this overwhelming self-accusation. Victims and aggressors alike are cornered. There is no exit.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, strangely, the composition is visually satisfying: it is jointed as by a master carpenter. That is the cruelest aspect of this work; it presents utter orderliness, as if to say: This is the way things are supposed to be, this is \"regularity.\" Not only the design, with its parallels and complementary angles, demonstrates this perverted \"law and order\"; the colors, too, appear well spaced and thoughtfully distributed. The woman in the right foreground may be wearing a blue corset because the tongue of the strangled man in the upper left turned blue and the painter needed a color-equilibrium. The torturer's tie may be yellow in order to correspond to the yellow wax of the candles.\r\n\r\n\"Beckmann has abandoned the Christian symbolism he used in previous works. There is no salvation in sight. One may consider the tiny window cross in the darkness outside as a symbol of hope, but otherwise the pressure in the tight little torture chamber is without relief.\r\n\r\n\"This is one moment in one attic in Germany at the end of World War I. There is no past and no future. The phonograph blares in order to blot out the cries of anguish. Its tune emphasizes the newsreel actuality of this happening: this is the present, this is the world.\r\n\r\n\"The complex psychological situations are boiled down to simple formulas. The young woman performing an involuntary split is menaced by the candle. The woman on the right, nonchalantly swept off her feet, will be unable to prevent the rape. The monkey-like sadist in the middle accomplishes his torture with scientific coolness, as if to test the degree of pain that a human being can stand. Only the dog on the left considers outside help as a possibility: he directs his howling away from the center, believing that there is somebody, something outside the confines of the frame. But he is not rational, of course!\r\n\r\n\"The foreground shows, for the first time in Beckmann's oeuvre, the pair of candles which he later used again and again in still lifes and triptychs: one has fallen and given up its ghost; the other carries bravely on. It is as if the artist wanted to leave one glimmer of hope, one little flickering light to negate the whole of darkness.\"\r\n\r\nLackner, Stephan. Max Beckmann (Master of the Art Series).

Eakins was sufficiently intrigued by the matches he saw to befriend several of the participants and to ask them to pose for him. The results were three major canvases\u2014[i]Taking the Count[/i] (1898), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-eakins/salutat-1898][i]Salutat[/i][/url] (1898\u2014Addison Gallery of American Art, Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass.), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-eakins/between-rounds-1899][i]Between Rounds[/i][/url] (1899)\u2014and about ten related sketches, studies, and portraits. \n\n[i]Taking the Count[/i] celebrates Thomas Eakins's lifelong fascination with athleticism and human endurance. A fallen fighter struggles to recover from a punishing blow, as all eyes in the crowd focus on the referee counting off the seconds that could mark the end of the match. The actual fight took place in Philadelphia on Friday, April 29, 1898, between Charley McKeever (standing) and Jack Daly and was refereed by H. Walter Schlichter. With this monumental painting, the first of Eakins's three great boxing pictures, the artist placed the theme into the context of the fine arts. Until Eakins undertook the subject, visual representations of prizefighting had been found almost exclusively in the press and in prints. One can think of few works by a serious artist of Eakins' era as far removed from the lofty propriety that dominated 19th-century American art as are these treatments of nearly nude boxers. [i]Taking the Count[/i] represents a stunning statement set against the sophisticated conventions of the period."

        "description": "Meg Lota Brown, professor of English at the University of Arizona, and Kari Boyd McBride, professor of Women's Studies at the same, consider The Proposition to be \"one of [Leyster's] most intriguing works from her period of greatest artistic output\". Marianne Berardi, an art historian specializing in Dutch Golden Age painting, states that it is \"perhaps her most notable painting\". Its most distinctive feature is how different it is to other contemporary Dutch and Fleming \"sexual proposition\" paintings, many falling into the Merry company genre. The convention for the genre, a common one at the time, was for the characters to be bawdy, and clearly both interested in sex, for money. The dress would be provocative, the facial expressions suggestive, and sometimes there would be a third figure of an older woman acting as a procuress. Indeed, in The Procuress by Dirck van Baburen, an example of the genre, that is exactly the case.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, in The Proposition the woman is depicted not as a whore but as an ordinary housewife, engaged in a simple everyday domestic chore. She isn't dressed provocatively. She does not display her bosom (but rather her blouse covers her all of the way to her neck). No ankles are visible. And she displays no interest in sex or even in the man at all. Contemporary Dutch literature stated the sort of activity in which she is engaged to be the proper behaviour for virtuous women in idle moments. Kirstin Olsen observed that male art critics \"so completely missed the point\" that the woman is, in contrast to other works, not welcoming the man's proposition that they mistakenly named the painting The Tempting Offer.\r\n\r\nThe foot warmer, whose glowing coals are visible beneath the hem of the woman's skirt, was a pictorial code of the time, and represented the woman's marital status. A foot warmer wholly under the skirt indicated a married woman who was unavailable, as it does in The Proposition; a foot warmer projecting halfway out from under the skirt with the woman's foot visible on it indicated one who might be receptive to a male suitor; and a foot warmer that is not under the woman at all, and empty of coals, indicated a single woman. This code can also be seen in Vermeer's The Milkmaid and Dou's The Young Mother.\r\n\r\nThe feminist reinterpretation of the picture largely originated with the work of Frima Fox Hofrichter who pointed out in 1975 (Hofrichter 1975) the difference between Leyster's painting and others of the genre and that it had served to set a precedent for other, later, artists, such as Gabri\u00ebl Metsu in his An Offer of Wine. According to Hofrichter, the woman in The Proposition is an \"embarrassed victim\" presented sympathetically and positively.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all art historians agree unequivocally with Hofrichter. For example: Wayne Franits, professor of fine art at Syracuse University, later critiqued Hofrichter, observing that an offer of money was a common beginning of a courtship at the time, so the painting might depict a simple honest attempt at courtship. Franits suggests the \"woman's unequivocally wholesome activity of sewing provided an important precedent for later genre paintings depicting domestic virtue\". A number of later genre scenes remain ambiguous in a similar way, most famously The Gallant Conversation (or The Paternal Admonition) from circa 1654 by Gerard ter Borch (the Younger), and The Hunter's Gift by Metsu (both Rijksmuseum)."

        "description": "With her back to the viewer, Wyeth's subject Anna Christina Olson stares into the distance, looking out at her farmhouse in Cushing, Maine. Suffering from a degenerative muscular disease, Christina was unable to walk. Wyeth said that she was \"limited physically but by no means spiritually\" and that \"the challenge was to do justice to her extraordinary conquest of a life which most people would consider hopeless.\" Her gaunt arms and legs and her slight frame make the figure seem vulnerable and isolated in the expansive field, and the viewer is put in an ambiguous position, looking at her from behind. The scene contains a sense of vulnerability, contributing to a certain foreboding feeling.\n\nTo say this is a true portrait of Christina Olson, though, would be misleading. While the pink dress and slim limbs belong to the then 55-year-old Olson, Wyeth used his young wife Betsy as the actual model here, thus fusing Christina's aging and abnormal body with that of a healthy, young one. Even though Wyeth wanted to depict Olson's plight, it can be interpreted that Wyeth made the subject an \"Everywoman\".\n\n[i]Christina's World[/i] presents an intriguing, open-ended narrative that appeals to the imagination. Who is Christina? Why is she in a field? Is that her house? Why does she seem to be crawling? The profundity that Wyeth was able to capture in this painting makes it one of the most well-known and admired pieces that the artist ever produced; however, it was not his personal favorite. Wyeth felt that the painting would have been more successful without the figure in the field. He remarked to an interviewer, \"When I was painting [i]Christina's World[/i] I would sit there by the hours working on the grass, and I began to feel I was really out in the field. I got lost in the texture of the thing. I remember going down into the field and grabbing up a section of earth and setting it on the base of my easel. It wasn't a painting I was working on. I was actually working on the ground itself.\"\n\nThe high level of detail Wyeth gave to every object in his paintings encourages intense inspection, but his titles reveal the inner significance of their outwardly straightforward subjects. The title [i]Christina\u2019s World[/i], courtesy of Wyeth\u2019s wife, indicates that the painting is more a psychological landscape than a portrait, a portrayal of a state of mind rather than a place."

        "description": "Homer developed a penchant for forceful realism early in his career. Following an apprenticeship in a Boston lithography shop, he supported himself as a freelance illustrator, creating a wide variety of popular images that subsequently were published as wood engravings in national periodicals like [i]Harper's Weekly[/i]. During the early 1860s, his themes ranged from the stylish seaside-resort life to the horrors of the battlefield. Following an extended trip to Europe in 1866\u20131867, Homer adopted a warmer palette, a looser brush technique, and an interest in painting outdoor scenes that owed much to the influence of contemporary French artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Courbet[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Manet[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet]Monet[/url].\n\nUpon his return to the United States, Homer turned his attention to lively scenes of sports and recreation, painting warm and appealing images that perfectly suited the prevalent postwar nostalgia for a simpler, more innocent America. [i]Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)[/i], painted during the country's centennial year, has become one of the best\u2013known and most beloved artistic images of life in 19th\u2013century America. \n\nExhibited to critical praise, [i]Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)[/i] shows a working father and his three sons on a catboat in the afternoon. Similar to a modern-day snapshot, the fishing boat seems about to speed out of view, the top of its mast already cropped out of the painting. Contrasting the sense of determined movement of the small craft in the foreground, a large sailboat leisurely crosses in the far background. Like his earlier works, Homer realistically depicted the scene, without a touch of sentiment. The stern look on the father's face as he steers the small boat is contrasted by the youthful postures of his sons, lost in their own thoughts, not quite attuned to the pressures of the adult's world. Perhaps this subtle contrast helped make the work one of Homer's most-loved depictions.\n\nThis simple painting, which appears so quintessentially American in tone demonstrates the influence of his brief stay in France in the previous decade. The subject reflects concerns he shared with the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/realism]Realist[/url] painters of France who similarly put the working figures in the immediate foreground of the composition. There is also a shift in Homer's gestural brushstrokes, which became increasingly confident after his trip to Paris, most notably in the sky and the sea. Finally, the compositional structure reveals a debt to the lessons of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/japonism]Japonism[/url] - the juxtaposition of extremely close-up objects against those in the deep background are seen from a slightly elevated position. In both style and subject, [i]Breezing Up[/i] anticipates themes that will resurface and dominate his oeuvre after his second trip to Europe in 1881."

The only African figure on the raft waves a cloth at the top of a pile of a few men who are struggling to get the attention of a ship in the distance (located on the far right of the horizon line). The sail of the raft is billowing in the wind while being tossed about a choppy ocean beneath a stormy sky. G\u00e9ricault paid great attention to the details in this work. He even [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/heads-of-torture-victims-study-for-the-raft-of-the-medusa]sketched severed body parts[/url] in order to make the image as authentic as possible.\n\nThe subject depicted is the artist's dramatic interpretation of the events beginning on July 2, 1816, when a French navy frigate crashed on its way to colonies in West Africa. The appointed governor of the colony and the top-ranking officers in the party left on the ship's six lifeboats leaving the remaining 147 passengers to be crowded onto a hastily made raft. When the raft proved too cumbersome, in a horrific act of cowardice and fear, the ship's leader cut the ropes to the raft. Left to fend for themselves for 13 days, the passengers eventually resorted to cannibalism. When rescued by a passing British ship, only 15 men were left alive, of whom 5 died before they were able to reach land. When the public learned of this, it became an international tragedy and a searing indictment of the current French government. \n\nThe decision to paint a scene from contemporary history - one that was utterly of the moment - brought instant attention to this work, particularly as Gericault translated it in a manner befitting classical history painting (large-scale, with heroic and tragic elements). The painting shocked the public and divided critics at the 1819 Salon. The shipwreck had scandalous political implications at home\u2014the incompetent captain, who had gained the position because of connections to the Bourbon Restoration government, fought to save himself and senior officers while leaving the lower ranks to die\u2014and so G\u00e9ricault\u2019s picture of the raft and its inhabitants was greeted with hostility by the government. Critics were divided: the horror and \"[i]terribilit\u00e0[/i]\" of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a \"pile of corpses,\" whose realism they considered a far cry from the \"ideal beauty\" incarnated by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet]Girodet[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet/pygmalion-et-galat-e-1819][i]Pygmalion and Galatea[/i] [/url](1819) which triumphed the same year. G\u00e9ricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Coupin (art critic of the Revue encyclop\u00e9dique) was categorical: \"Monsieur G\u00e9ricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel.\"\n\nDisappointed by the reception of [i]The Raft of the Medusa[/i], G\u00e9ricault took the painting to England in 1820, where it was received as a sensational success. He remained there for two years, enjoying the equine culture and producing a body of lithographs, watercolors, and oils of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/the-horse-race-1824-1]jockeys and horses[/url]. \n\nThis work is a key example of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism]Romantic[/url] painting. In creating it, G\u00e9ricault showed a complexity of composition and an almost unsettling portrayal of reality, differed from anything that had been seen before.

The redhead helps the blonde take an accurate measurement in what could be construed as an act of communal sisterhood. Yet the overblown size of their breasts hints at the pair's entrapment within a society that values individual physical endowments in warped disproportion to the whole. Their body parts are magnified as distracting objects of attention. The crude rendering of the women's faces presents an antagonistic contrast to the other elements in the painting to which we are drawn instead, participating unconsciously in the act of sexism.\n\nCurrin has remarked about this painting, \"I had already received a small amount of criticism about my sexism, and I wanted to make something that I wouldn't have to worry about being termed sexist - because the image is so sexist that it's sort of beyond repair.\""

The themes of children and childhood reflected Cassatt\u2019s deep affection for her family, including many nieces and nephews. Young Mother Sewing depicts a young mother, intently sewing, as her small child carelessly flops onto her lap. Undeterred, the mother continues to finish her work.

        "description": "[i]The painter and his family[/i] (ca. 1939) by Andr\u00e9 Derain is more than a self-portrait or family portrait, it is a manifesto of Derain\u2019s beliefs and views on painting. Much like the 19th century [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet/the-artist-s-studio-1855][i]The Artist\u2019s Studio[/i][/url] (1854-1855) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Gustave Courbet[/url], the painting is an allegorical representation of the life of an artist. While Courbet presented himself among admirers and members of the public, Derain surrounded himself with female family members and pets. The scene did not reflect his working conditions, Derain usually worked in a studio away from his family. The emphasis on the intimate and domestic realm possibly expressed his desire to withdraw from the public and the worsening political situation of the inter-war period. In this period, Derain especially identified with 17th century painters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez]Diego Velasquez[/url]. It is possible that The painter and his family was inspired by Velasquez\u2019s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/las-meninas-detail-of-the-lower-half-depicting-the-family-of-philip-iv-of-spain-1656][i]Las Meninas[/i][/url] (1656), in which the artist is seen at the studio painting the young girls of the Spanish royal court.\n\nThe painting depicts Derain working at his easel, while his wife Alice reads a book of myths. This is a reference to their common interest in legends and myths. Derain also painted a peacock, a reference to chivalric literature and a cat that symbolized his fascination with arcane and mystical practices. The painting relates to an earlier work by Derain, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andre-derain/the-artist-in-his-studio-1920][i]The Artist in his Studio[/i][/url] (1920), that also shows the artist painting at his easel. [i]The Artist in his Studio[/i] depicts a similar domestic environment: his wife Alice is reading in the background while a small boy holds a bowl of fruit in the foreground. The two paintings have a similar dark palette, mainly black with highlights of green, red and white. However, the scene in [i]The painter and his family[/i] is richer in detail and occupied by more figures. Suzanne G\u00e9ry, Alice\u2019s sister, is seen in the background holding a tray, while her daughter Genevi\u00e8ve is behind the artist holding a small pooch. \n\nSuzanne and Genevi\u00e8ve were an intimate part of Derain\u2019s family circle: from 1928 the two lived in the Derain\u2019s home, and later in 1935 they moved to La Roseraie at Chambourcy, where they lived across the courtyard from Derain and his wife. Derain treated Genevi\u00e8ve as his own daughter, and painted her many times. In [i]The painter and his family[/i] her face is luminous, and her position behind the artist places her in the role of a guiding light or a muse. In addition, the dog is a medieval symbol of fidelity: his presence can signify Genevi\u00e8ve\u2019s loyalty to the artist or maybe Derain\u2019s loyalty and devotion to art. The symbolism and atmosphere of [i]The painter and his family[/i] corresponds with Derain\u2019s understanding of painting. Derain believed that art should \u2018equalize time\u2019, meaning that regardless of its superficial form, art should deal with universal truths that define the human experience. In both [i]The Artist in his Studio[/i] and [i]The painter and his family[/i] Derain proclaimed that the nature of art to be private and intimate, and therefore he depicted himself working in a domestic setting."

He took a leading role in the Art Society of NSW, which undertook art instruction and exhibitions for the most significant artists of the day and was an early Trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales (1889-99), where he championed the collection of contemporary Australian art by the Gallery. However it was the example Ashton set as a painter and as a teacher at his eponymous Sydney Art School (est. 1890) that was to have the most profound effect on a generation of \u2018Bohemian\u2019 artists who wished to forge a distinctively independent school of painters of Australian life and landscape.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this atmospheric, poetic watercolour is the ferry wharf at Mosman\u2019s Bay \u2013 a popular subject for a number of artists associated with the artists\u2019 camps of Mosman in the 1880s and 90s. Situated in the next bay, Little Sirius Cove, was the artists\u2019 Curlew Camp, and further to the north was the Edwards Beach camp, (today\u2019s Balmoral Beach), where Ashton was a frequent resident. This watercolour was painted the same year his other watercolour, 'A solitary ramble' 1880, was acquired by the AGNSW.\r\n\r\nDepicted in the centre of the painting is Lewis\u2019s Refreshment Rooms, built next to the wharf and a focus of leisure for leisure and relaxation, although a place of comparative bustle and activity compared to the more isolated artists\u2019 camps nearby. Ashton championed the practice of painting outdoors (en plein air); this work captures the impressions of nature \u2013 sunlight, haze, water \u2013 as well as the human activity by the foreshore, witnessed in all its prosaic everyday-ness by the artist in its midst."

The results come close to abstraction. In Sea Grasses and Blue Sea (based on Avery's memories of Provincetown, Massachusetts), the sky is a straight and narrow blue band at the painting's upper rim. The rest of the canvas is divided into two trapezoids of almost equal size and shape. The lower of these, the sea grass, is pale and lightly streaked, and echoes the tonality of the sky; above it is a wedge of a predominantly darker, saturated blue, with patches both of a lighter blue and, more sharply, of deep black. Magically, the overall effect is of waves flecked with white foam.\r\nThat black is paradoxical: as Matisse remarked of the black in one of his own paintings, it is used as \"a color of light and not as a color of darkness.\" In various ways, in fact, Avery is closer to Henri Matisse than to the styles that prevailed in America during his lifetime-in his love of clarified form and flat color, for example, and in the sense of rich serenity that permeates his art."

Adonis is shown with hounds that will accompany him on a hunt with a wild boar, which ultimately leads to his demise. A pair of doves symbolizing love is depicted in the foreground, while an intricate landscape featuring ancient ruins and chaotic skies infuses the narrative with drama.\n\nCarracci's painting showcases his diverse range of influences, drawing from Veronese, Titian, and Greco-Roman sculptures. Both Veronese and Titian also painted this fable, and similarities can be drawn between the compositional approach of all three artists. The interaction between Venus and Adonis takes place in front of a naturalistic landscape, displaying Carracci's skill as a naturalist painter. The sculptural formation of the figures' bodies, combined with the use of light to illuminate the smooth texture of their skin, creates a subtle realism that contrasts with the preferences of the Mannerists. Carracci's ability to play with light is further showcased in the cloth materials, particularly in the iridescent sheen of Adonis's robe."

As was customary during the Third Intermediate Period, Nany's coffins and boxes of [i]shabtis[/i] (funerary figurines) were accompanied by a hollow wooden Osiris figure, which contained a papyrus scroll inscribed with a collection of texts called the [i]\"Book of Coming Forth by Day\"[/i] \u2013 better known to us as the [i]Book of the Dead[/i]. When unrolled, this scroll is more than seventeen feet long.\n\nThe scene depicted here shows the climax of the journey to the afterlife. Nany is in the Hall of Judgment. Holding her mouth and eyes in her hand, she stands to the left of a large scale. Her heart is being weighed against Maat, the goddess of justice and truth, who is represented as a tiny figure wearing her symbol, a single large feather, in her headband. On the right, Osiris, god of the underworld and rebirth, presides over the scene. He wears the white crown of Upper Egypt and the curving beard of a god. His body is wrapped like a mummy except for his hands, which clasp a crook. On the table before him is an offering of a joint of beef. Canine-headed Anubis, overseer of mummification, adjusts the scales, while a baboon\u2014symbolizing Thoth, the god of wisdom and writing\u2014sits on the balance beam and prepares to write down the result. Behind Nany stands the goddess Isis, both wife and sister of Osiris. She is identified by the hieroglyph above her head.\n\nIn this scene, Nany has been found truthful and therefore worthy of entering the afterlife. Anubis says to Osiris, \"Her heart is an accurate witness,\" and Osiris replies,\" Give her her eyes and her mouth, since her heart is an accurate witness.\" In the horizontal register above the judgment scene, Nany appears in three episodes: worshipping the divine palette with which all is written, praising a statue of Horus in his falcon form, and standing by her own tomb.\n\n[url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/548344]The Met[/url]"

        "description": "[i]Found[/i] (1854-1855, 1859-1881) is a unique painting in the body of the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood]Pre-Raphaelite[/url] artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It was the artist\u2019s only attempt at a contemporary subject, urban prostitution. The subject of the \u2018fallen woman,\u2019 that described any woman partaking in sexual activity outside wedlock became increasingly popular in 19th-century art and literary circles. Like his contemporaries, Rossetti was also interested in the theme of the \u2018fallen woman\u2019: he painted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/the-gate-of-memory-1864][i]The Gate of Memory[/i][/url] (1864), a watercolor based on a scene from the poem [i]Maryanne[/i] by William Bell Scott and wrote [i]Jenny[/i], a sympathetic poem about a prostituted woman.\n\nThe scene in [i]Found[/i] shows a young countryman coming to London to bring a calf to sell at the market. He sees his former sweetheart, now a prostituted girl, and attempts to reach out and save her from her terrible fate. The male figure in [i]Found[/i] is the woman\u2019s rescuers, by \u2018finding\u2019 her, he offers the woman a chance at salvation. Rossetti identified his savior with the countryside; the man wears a rustic smock and boots that indicate he is an agricultural worker. In this way, he represents an innocent and idyllic past associated with the countryside before the woman was corrupted by sexuality and immorality found in the city.\n\nFound closely relates to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt/the-awakening-conscience-1853][i]The Awakening Conscience[/i][/url] (1853) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-holman-hunt]William Holman Hunt[/url], who, like Rossetti, was one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Although the two paintings are different in structure and appearance, they offer opposite representations of the same theme. In Hunt\u2019s painting, the situation is reversed: the male figure represents a predator, and the young woman\u2019s awakening of conscience comes from singing a song about the idyllic past of the countryside. Both Rossetti and Hunt seek salvation in the notion of the countryside, an idyllic place that represents pre-sexual innocence and romance. However, by adding the calf to the composition, Rossetti gave [i]Found[/i] another dimension and a sense of ambiguity. The calf is tethered to the cart, and it awaits its death once sold on the market. The man, the woman\u2019s rescuer is also the calf\u2019s caretaker, and the viewer is left to wonder about the woman\u2019s faith. Would she indeed find salvation, or is she destined to end up like the calf sold on the market?  \n\nRossetti considered [i]Found[/i] one of his most important works, he worked on the painting up until he died in 1882, but it remained unfinished. The artist grappled with the artwork for nearly three decades, and over the period, it went through numerous transformations. Originally the prostituted was an unknown woman, but later, Rossetti repainted the figure to portray Fanny Cornforth, one of his favorite models. The artist also struggled with several technical elements in the painting. Rossetti\u2019s friend [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ford-madox-brown]Ford Madox Brown[/url] wrote about the painstaking process of painting the calf: \u201c[i]getting on slowly he paints it in all like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer]Albrecht D\u00fcrer[/url] hair by hair and seems incapable of any breadth[/i].\u201d The artist\u2019s assistants, Henry Treffry Dunn and Frederic Shields, helped with the painting. Additionally, it is possible that the artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-burne-jones]Edward Burne-Jones[/url] also worked on some aspects of [i]Found[/i]."

        "description": "The famed Shakespearean actress Dame Alice Ellen Terry is the subject of John Singer Sargent\u2019s portrait [i]Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth[/i] (1889). Terry came from a family of well-known actors and became the leading Shakespearean actress in Britain. From 1878, she became the leading lady of the Henry Irving company, and over the next two decades, she and Irving achieved great success touring in Britain and the United States. \n\nThe painting shows Terry in her famous role of Lady Macbeth that she played in Irving\u2019s production of Macbeth at the Lyceum Theatre in London. Sargent saw the first performance on December 29, 1888, and was immediately drawn to the actress\u2019s costume and performance. Even though Terry was hesitant to sit for the artist until she was more certain of the play's success, it seems she began posing for the portrait shortly after their initial encounter. This is confirmed by Sargent in a letter he wrote on January 1, 1889, where he mentioned the poor lighting that slowed down his progress. \n\nThe pose in the painting was Sargent\u2019s innovation: Lady Macbeth holds up the royal crown that she is about to place on her head. This scene does not appear in the play, and there is no evidence that the dramatic pose was part of Irving\u2019s production of Macbeth. The pose is indicative of Lady Macbeth\u2019s intoxication with power, and Terry\u2019s expressive qualities as an actress: her eyes are glazed and ecstatic, she is not a symbol of moderation and innocence associated with Victorian womanhood but an icon of decadence. Terry wore her Lady Macbeth costume, a gown designed by Alice Comyns Carr and made by Ada Nettleship. The lavish dress was embroidered in gold and decorated with 1,000 iridescent wings of green jewel beetles, as well as diamonds and rubies. Terry with her luscious red braids and brilliant green and blue garment resembles a queen in a Celtic legend. This was not the only time Sargent painted Terry: the grisaille sketch [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/ellen-terry-as-lady-macbeth-1906][i]Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth[/i] (1906)[/url], shows Lady Macbeth waiting to greet Duncan. Sargent created this drawing for Ellen Terry Jubilee Program in 1906. \n\nEllen Terry mentioned the 1889 portrait in her Memories recalling that it was the sensation of the year. The famous author, Oscar Wilde who observed Sargent and Terry\u2019s collaboration, wrote about Terry posing for Sargent: [i]\u201cThe street that on a wet and dreary morning has vouchsafed the vision of Lady Macbeth in full regalia magnificently seated in a four-wheeler can never again be as other streets: it must always be full of other possibilities.\u201d[/i] Terry also wrote that before Sargent finished the portrait, the artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-burne-jones]Edward Burne-Jones[/url] suggested slight alterations to the coloring which Sargent accepted. Irving bought [i]Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth[/i] for the Beefsteak Room at the Lyceum Theatre, where it hung in an alcove. After Irving\u2019s death in 1905, the painting was bought by Sir Joseph Joel Duveen, who donated it to the Tate Gallery in 1906."

The four stages of human life are reflected in the passage of the seasons across the paintings, nature serving as a mirror for man's emotional condition, in quintessential [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/romanticism]Romantic[/url] style.\n\nThe [i]Voyage of Life[/i] was commissioned by the banker Samuel Ward and was meant to remind the viewer of the course that must be steered to secure a resting place in eternity. In so doing, these works tap into the cultural mood in America during the 1840s, when a period of intense religious revivalism was underway. At the same time, the 'voyage of life' may be read as an allegory for the progress of American civilization, which was, at this time, in a promising but uncertain stage of its growth. The compositional style exemplifies Cole's approach in combining rugged, American-style landscapes with motifs and techniques borrowed from European landscape painting in both the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/neoclassicism]Neoclassical[/url] and Romantic styles.\n\n The [i]Voyage of Life[/i] paintings were so popular that they became a source of dispute between Cole, who wanted to keep them on public display, and his patron Samuel Ward, who tried to keep them for his private collection, refusing to sell the paintings back to the artist. In the end, Cole created a second version of the series while visiting Europe in 1842. On a personal note, he had converted to the Episcopal Church in 1941, and these paintings are the best example of the religiously allegorical work which he produced during the last years of his life.

        "description": "In 1933, Nash visited the village of Avebury, in Wiltshire, southwest England. He became \"excited and fascinated\" by the Neolithic monuments and standing stones that he found there, in which he saw at once \"magic\" and \"sinister beauty\". He painted the landscape several times in different styles, and in this case, he introduces abstraction to further highlight the sense of mystery encountered at the site. In a letter to the then Director of the Tate Gallery (from 1951), Nash's widow wrote that [i]Equivalents for the Megaliths[/i] had \"a beautiful design, and is, in my opinion, the most important of the Megalith series of paintings\".\n\nIn [i]Equivalents for the Megaliths[/i], Nash re-imagines the historic standing stones as abstract forms typical of contemporary sculpture. In a statement on the painting, written in 1937, the artist speaks of the monuments' dual appeal: their impressive age value and their capacity to represent bygone eras; and their formal, geometric appeal (\"lines masses and planes, directions, and volume\"). The artist felt that both the history and geometry of these stones lent them a mystical presence.\n\nIndeed, Barbara Hepworth's [i]Two Forms With Sphere[/i] (1934) could have been an influence on this painting, as may have been the nineteenth century artist, Thomas Guest's [i]Finds from a Round Barrow at Winterslow, Wiltshire[/i] (1814), a fellow artist deeply interested in archeology and the ancient remains of past English civilizations. Some critics have also noted the painting's similarity to his brother John Nash's [i]The Cornfield[/i] (1918) in the geometric and ordered treatment of landscape. This is perhaps in deliberate contrast to Nash's previous war paintings, which are characterized by chaos, ruin, and disarray, an attempt in pictures to re-establish harmony and balance.\n\nAt this point Paul Nash had fully recovered from his breakdown in the early 1920s that had come about as a result of \"war strain\". During the decade that followed he built a friendship and artistic relationship with fellow English modernist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ben-nicholson]Ben Nicholson[/url]. As result, in 1933, Nash formed a group called [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/unit-one#!#resultType:masonry]Unit One[/url] that included Nicholson and his wife, Hepworth. [i]Equivalents for the Megaliths[/i] was exhibited during the two years that Nash was affiliated with this group. He shares his subdued, understated, and pastel palette with Nicholson and the interest in organic geometrical forms with Hepworth. Furthermore, the two great painters both had a love for landscape but whereas Nash always remained more lyrical, Nicholson engaged further with abstraction.\n\n[url href=https://www.theartstory.org/artist/nash-paul/artworks/][b]by TheArtStory[/b][/url]"

Rivera\u2019s jarring vision of the city\u2014in which the masses trudge to work, the homeless are warehoused, and the wealthy squirrel away their money\u2014struck a chord in 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression."

Unlike Titian\u2019s Venus de Urbino or Giorgione\u2019s Sleeping Venus, both of which were sources of inspiration for Olympia, Manet\u2019s work was overtly sexual. The small bits of clothing, such as the orchid in her hair, jewelry, and the mule slippers, in addition to the fully clothed servant, seem to make the figure seem even more nude. Her confrontational gaze was an affront to the perfunctory modesty with which women were supposed to behave. "

        "description": "This canvas represents an ideal watershed and an absolute summit in Induno's artistic parable. The complementary aspects of his production, the emotional realism of the battle canvases painted on the true and the private sentimentality of the genre canvases, are now summarized in an ideological realism that rediscovers a dimension of absolute modernity. In the aftermath of unity, it was necessary to transfer the forces of the Risorgimento to the general level of national belonging. Precisely in this collective dimension there was an answer to the spiritual sense of the Risorgimento struggle that allows us to interpret the compositional system and the dosage of space and pathos within a classical order: the vertical partition of the floors corresponds to a skilful alternation of solids and voids and sudden perspective cuts. If the Indunian research focuses on important details - the musket and the leather gibern of the bandolier, the sword of the saber, the saddle bundled with the blue cloth overcoat, the pistol, the straw bundle, the mess tin and the royal figures embroidered in white thread on the ends of the saddle cloth - it is to empathize with the spiritual meaning of military life. The choral and ideological universe of this work would thus have represented in the eyes of contemporaries and clients the independence aspirations of an entire people, namely the collective conscience of the nation.\n\n(Description taken from the site)"

She painted a mourning painting, Portrait of Simone in a red jacket that she placed in evidence in her farm in Goxwiller alongside the portrait of Lionel who died a few years later, in 1990. In 1987, with the help of Marcelle Routier, she published her own memoirs [9]. Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir had Simone de Beauvoir's letters published to Jean-Paul Sartre in which she described her sister as an artist without talent. She was deeply hurt.

        "description": "Piero has set the Christmas story in his own time. The flat land on top of the hill where they stand evokes Tuscany, as does the winding valley to the left. Meanwhile the skyline on the right, dominated by the basilica, could almost be the outskirts of Piero's home town Borgo Sansepolcro. The painting shows the impact of Northern European painting. Piero painted with tempera early in his career, but for later works like this one he began working in oil. Along with the use of brown under-painting for the figures, this shows a familiarity with Netherlandish and Flemish work. This is reinforced by the slim figure of Christ, who lacks the square muscularity of contemporary depictions from Italy, and is more reminiscent of paintings by artists like Hugo van der Goes. Piero has also experimented with perspective. It is the only one of his works that shows a building askew from the rest of the composition: this is the simple shed, which reminds the viewer of Christ's humble beginnings. It is possible that this panel was never completed. It has certainly been damaged, possibly by the work of a 19th-century restorer. Nevertheless, the painting holds more than enough detail to give a sense of a complete composition, one which is likely to have been among the last the artist created."

        "style": "romanticism",
        "description": "[i]Lady Lilith[/i] (1866-1868, altered 1872-1873) belongs to Rossetti's famous series of half-length female portraits, which started with the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/bocca-baciata-1859][i]Bocca Baciata[/i][/url] (1859). The subject of the painting originates from Jewish mythology:  Lilith was the first wife of Adam, and unlike Eve, she was created at the same time and from the same clay as Adam. In one version of the legend, Lilith betrayed Adam, after refusing to be his subordinate, and fled the Garden of Eden to join the fallen angel Samael. She is a demonic figure and seductress, known in folklore stories for killing babies and bewitching men.\n\nIn a letter from 1870 to his friend Dr. Hake, Rossetti wrote about the painting: \"[i]The picture\u2026 represents a Modern Lilith combing out her abundant golden hair and gazing on herself in the glass with complete self-absorption by whose fascination such natures draw others within their circle.[/i]\" Rossetti wrote the sonnet [i]Body's Beauty[/i] that accompanies the painting. In the sonnet, he describes Lilith the seductress, who entraps young men with the strains of her golden hair. Rossetti represents Lilith's dangerous nature through her luscious hair, as well as the paraphernalia surrounding her. The roses, a flower associated with Aphrodite, symbolize sensuality, while the poppies signify sleep and forgetfulness. On the dresser under the mirror is a spray of foxglove, which can be used as a medicine, but also as a deadly poison. The painting forms a pendant with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/sibylla-palmifera][i]Sibylla Palmifera[/i][/url] (ca. 1865-1870) that was accompanied by Rossetti's sonnet [i]Soul's Beauty[/i]. The two figures embody contrasting ideas: Lilith represents bodily sin and vice, while Sibylla signifies the ideal of female virtue.\n\nScholars have suggested that Lady Lilith was inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]'s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/vanitas-1515][i]Woman with a Mirror[/i][/url] (1515). Rossetti saw the painting during his trip to Paris in 1864, where he spent his time exploring the Louvre's collection. The two paintings share several pictorial elements: Rossetti emulated Titian's treatment of the female's flesh, as well as the central parting and the wavy curls of the cascading hair. Additionally, Rossetti referred to [i]Lady Lilith[/i] as a 'toilette painting,' reinforcing the assumption that Titian's work influenced him. The painting is also linked to the portrait [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet/portrait-of-jo-the-beautiful-irish-girl-1865][i]Jo, the Beautiful Irish Girl[/i][/url] (1865) by French Realist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Gustave Courbet[/url]. It is possible that Courbet was inspired by Rossetti, who visited his studio during his stay in Paris in 1864.  \n\nRossetti worked on the painting for several years and created at least four related drawings of the composition, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/study-for-lady-lilith-1866][i]Study for Lady Lilith[/i][/url] (1886), as well as watercolor replicas like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dante-gabriel-rossetti/lady-lilith-1867][i]Lady Lilith[/i][/url] (1867). The model in the preparatory drawings, watercolors, and the original oil painting is Fanny Cornforth, Rossetti's housekeeper, and mistress. The painting was commissioned by Rossetti's patron Frederick Leyland, who received the picture in the spring of 1869. However, in 1872 Leyland asked Rossetti for a significant alteration: he wanted to substitute Cornforth's face with that of Alexa Wilding, who Leyland felt had more 'refined' features. It remains unclear whether Rossetti agreed with Leyland's assessment and whether he was ultimately pleased with the outcome."

Note in particular the lovely way Friedrich has conveyed the snow and wind of this cold day.\r\n\r\nNote in particular the shape of the tree, and the way it is contrasted with the solid mass of the ruin to the right. Friedrich loved to use dead (or at least life-less) trees in order to accentuate their form. This is one of his first attempts to catch the beauty and horror in the grotesque shape, and to use these trees to \"symbolize\" human failings."

The painting was commissioned by the French government and won the gold medal of Salon in 1849.\n\nA French critic Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9 wrote about this painting: \"Mademoiselle Rosa paints almost like a man.\" It is a motif that lived through the history of art. When a man wanted to praise a woman artist, he told a phrase like that, implying that a woman art was inferior, and a good woman artist was an exception.\n\nThe painting is extremely realistic. Bonheur accurately painted the anatomy of animals, and of men, to the point of making them look fatigued: the poses show all the sacrifices necessary to tame a heavy matter of the earth. The hooves and the feet sink into the ground. The perspective chosen by the artist makes the whole scene not the banal representation of the work of the fields, but a subject that is both realistic and epic. The tense muscles, the size of the animals, the expressions, the dark skin of the peasants: everything contributes to it. The humble sense of realism that emanates from the canvas recalls the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/camille-corot]Camille Corot[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Gustave Courbet[/url].

        "description": "In 1973, at the age of 84, Thomas Hart Benton was asked to paint a mural for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee. He was encouraged to take on the ambitious project by famous country music singer, Tex Ritter, who suggested that he paint a large visual summary of the roots of country music. The result was [i]The Sources of Country Music[/i] (1975), a large multifigure composition that presents five distinct scenes describing the music of ordinary Americans.\n\nThe central motif is a barn dance with two fiddlers and a group of square dancers, which represent the dominant music of the American frontier. On the upper left of the painting, three women dressed for Sunday church sing with hymnals in their hands, emphasizing the importance of church music in Protestant America. In front of the church choir, he painted two barefoot mountain women that sing and play the dulcimer \u2013 a string instrument associated with the music of the Appalachian region in America. On the right, Benton added an armed cowboy singer strumming his guitar, an homage to Tex Ritter. Ritter died while Benton was working on the mural, and the Country Music Foundation agreed to dedicate the mural to the country singer. In a letter to the Foundation, Benton suggested to incorporate Ritter in the mural: \u201cI go for the idea that the mural should come in some way be a tribute to Tex Ritter. Why don\u2019t we symbolize Tex in the cowboy singer?\u201d. Further away from the cowboy, there is a black man, likely a cotton picker, playing the banjo \u2013 an instrument that was brought by slaves to America. In the background, a train is speeding through, and beyond the railroad track, a group of black women dances on the distant riverbank. The Sources of Country Music like Benton\u2019s art in general has a characteristically dynamic style and composition. The mural expresses the powerful rhythm of music: many of the figures seem unstable, trying to balance on an even, shifting ground, and even the telephone poles in the background seem to sway to the sides.\nThe mural represents the various cultural influences on country music, many of which are part of an American folkway that was quickly vanishing. The train signifies advancement, which can highlight both the positive and negative aspects of American progress. These advancements led to a more uniform and homogenous American culture, but as a result, many regional customs disappeared. Benton modeled the train in the painting after the Cannonball Special. This alludes to the popular folk song [i]The Wabash Cannonball[/i], which describes the scenic beauty and the surroundings found on the Great Rock Island train route. It is said that Benton was not entirely happy with the appearance of the train and had considered repainting it. Some have even suggested that the artist died of a heart attack on January 19, 1975, while he was standing in front of the mural trying to decide if he should repaint the train. Whether the story is true or not, the mural was probably not complete as Benton did not sign it."

Upon its debut, Guillaume Apollinaire, referencing the negative reviews of previous years, exclaimed that this year, there would be no ridicule, as the painting exuded sheer beauty. With this piece, Rousseau brought together the exotic and the ordinary, the jungle and the couch, and combined the two to form a juxtaposition of composition which engages and intrigues. It is perhaps fitting that this was his last painting before his death, as it was his masterpiece. "

While he received major commissions of significant society figures in the early twentieth century Bunny's earlier portraits feature his associates, family and friends and his subjects are telling of the connections that Bunny's made throughout his time in Europe.\r\n\r\nOne of Bunny's exceptional early portraits is 'Portrait of C.F. Keary' (c1891). The subject of this work is Charles Francis Keary (1848-1917) a British author of works of history, philosophy and later fiction and poetry. He was also a medal winner (in 1894) of the Royal Numismatic Society and worked in coin and medals department at the British Museum.\r\n\r\n'Portrait of C.F. Keary' reveals the impact of Whistler's essentialism, tonalism and emphasis on design on Bunny's early portrait work. The painting's overall subdued aesthetic and Bunny's approach to portraiture as a means of recording fact, are elements distinct from the colour emphasis and psychological and symbolist undercurrents that otherwise characterised his work from this period."

By 1900, however, the painting was well on its way to becoming a national icon. That year, inspired by Gyzis's painting, the poet Ioannis Polemis (1862\u20131924) wrote \"The Secret School,\"33 which, through its inclusion in school textbooks, served to further perpetuate the myth."

        "description": "Settling in Paris in 1952, Freud painted many portraits, including Hotel Bedroom (1954), which features a woman lying in a bed with white sheets pulled up to her shoulders. Her left hand rests on her cheek, and her gaze is fixed on a faraway place. In sharp contrast, a standing man is standing behind her and staring at her. His dark form looms over her menacingly, silhouetted against the sunlight. Other windows in the building across the street are visible in the background.\n\nThe man is Freud himself, and the woman is Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood, the Guinness ale heiress with whom he eloped in 1952 after the divorce from his first wife. At the time they were staying at the Hotel La Louisiane, and the work reflects the anxiety and tension in their relationship, which had already begun to unravel. She would soon leave him, and the distraught Freud, while having many more relationships, would never marry again. This painting is among the works that Freud exhibited it at the Venice Biennale when he was invited to serve as the representative of Britain in 1954, a great honor. Like this and other early portraits by the artist, the work has a flat, drawing-like quality. Here, however, the body of the artist is a black hole, threatening to suck the light out of the rest of the picture. The artist's standing pose also seems to predict a turning point in his working method. This is the last portrait he completed while sitting down. From that point on, he chose to stand while painting. One of his more narrative works, it exemplifies the autobiographical self-absorption and detachment associated with his later work."

Two angels hold an open book, and two angels crown Mary as Queen of Heaven. This work exemplifies Botticelli's use of line, color, and composition, to draw the viewer into a vision of refined beauty. Advancing an artistic language, it combines visual naturalism and spiritual grace.\n\nThe art of Botticelli expresses a new closeness to a sacred reality: his capacity to visualize the spiritual intimacy made him one of the most sought-after painters of 15th century Florence. [i]The Magnificat[/i], also known as [i]The song of Mary[/i], is the Virgin's prayer spoken to her cousin Elizabeth in the [i]Gospel of Luke[/i]. When they met, St. John the Baptist, in the womb of Elizabeth, exults perceiving the presence of Christ in Mary's womb. Botticelli chose not to illustrate the biblical episode of the Visitation. Instead, he imagines a scene that is theologically built on Mary's prayer, translating the spirit of the sacred expression into visual art. \n\nMary's [i]Magnificat[/i] is her responsive praise to God, for the spiritual transformation that He has caused. In her right hand, the Virgin holds a quilt, by which she is writing her prayer into a book. \"My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed.\" In her left hand, she holds a pomegranate. The Infant Christ seems to be taking this fruit - a symbol of his passion (innumerable grains of the pomegranate corresponds to the infinite drops of blood that will pour for the salvation of Humanity.) Mary's robe is painted by Botticelli to frame Christ as if it was a tent or even a tabernacle, and Christ was emerging out of it.\n\nThe painting is suspended between two dimensions. The first one is Paradise, where the angels crown Madonna, with an impalpable tiara, to be Queen of Paradise. And the second one is Earth, where Botticelli depicted a Tuscan landscape with florentine river Arno. With his superb technique, the artist magnifies the material painting in a splendorous vision of Glory. Botticelli's art unites visual naturalism and spiritual grace. The significance of his aesthetic comes into better focus if we recognize him as a Florentine painter of devotional subjects working in the second half of the 15th century, a period in which artists developed a pictorial naturalism to connect sacred scenes to the reality. Botticelli found his own language, opening with his art a window between two worlds, material and immaterial.\n\n[u]By Maddalena Mongera[/u]"

The first version of this artwork had been made 30 years before the Op-art concept was conceived; however, it is considered to be a part of this movement. The last version of [i]Zebra[/i] was created in 1965.\n \nBetween 1939 and 1948, Vasarely laid out the fundamentals of Op-art in his early works. He was focused on studying the use of lines, the interaction between shadow and light, and the creation of perspective. Vasarely once affirmed: \u201cThe celebrated transition from the representational to nonrepresentational art is only one of the stages of profound transformation taking place in the plastics arts. The term \u2018abstract\u2019 in painting refers not to an established fact, but to an irresistible trend towards plastic creation different from the kind we already know.\u201d\n \n[i]Zebra[/i] can be apprehended as a study of shape, contrasts, and optical illusions. It seems like Vasarely picked the adequate animal for representing in one of the firsts pieces of the Op-art movement. In [i]Zebra[/i] from 1937, the animals pose in front of a white background, and the contrast is obvious. Even though the background color is different, the same effect occurs with the [i]Zebra[/i] from 1965. The stripes of the animal mesh with the background (especially in the 1965 piece) because the drawing doesn\u2019t have borders. Also, curvilinear stripes of the zebras create an illusion of movement, playing with the awareness of the human eye."

During the time this painting was created, Mondrian began developing his philosophical ideas on theosophy and anthroposophy, two spiritual movements which allowed Mondrian to see painting as a search for spiritual knowledge within oneself. Although his earlier works depicted dim figures or abstracted colors, his search for spiritual enlightenment within and throughout his paintings was to lead through a pathway of more abstract forms.
