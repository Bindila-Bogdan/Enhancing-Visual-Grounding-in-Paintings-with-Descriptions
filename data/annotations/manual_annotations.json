While an identification with Saint Mary of Egypt cannot be completely eliminated, this picture more likely shows Christ's follower Mary Magdalen, who, according again to The Golden Legend, took refuge in a grotto near Marseilles, where she was visited daily by angels, who gave her divine sustenance through their songs. In the seventeenth century emphasis was placed on Mary Magdalen's conversion and/or penitence. As Mary Magdalen was thought to be a converted prostitute, Baroque poets and artists showed her as at once beautiful and penitent, thereby creating an image that combines sensuous beauty with deep feeling."
